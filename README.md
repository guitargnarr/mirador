# Mirador AI Framework

A personal AI orchestration system for chaining specialized Ollama models across different domains.

## Overview

Mirador enables you to chain specialized AI models in sequence to solve complex problems across different domains:

- **Guitar/Music**: Practice routines, technique analysis, tablature generation
- **Business/Productivity**: Task management, project planning, content creation
- **Financial Planning**: Budget management, investment strategies
- **Career Development**: Skill development, learning paths, job strategies
- **Code/Development**: Code generation, documentation, architecture design

## Features

- **Model Chaining**: Sequence multiple specialized models for complex problems
- **Workflow Integration**: Domain-specific templates and workflows
- **Output Management**: Categorized storage with search and export capabilities
- **Progress Visualization**: Visual feedback showing how specialists transform solutions
- **Robust Logging**: Structured logging with error handling
- **Shell Integration**: Aliases and functions for command-line convenience
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Test suites for model and chain evaluation

## Requirements

- Ollama (latest version)
- jq
- bash/zsh
- Optional: pandoc (for export features)

### Test Environment

This framework has been tested on:
- Macbook Pro with M3 Max chip, 36GB RAM, 1TB SSD
- All test outputs and performance metrics are based on this configuration

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repository
2. Run the setup script: `./scripts/setup.sh`
3. Try a chain: `./scripts/run_chain.sh "Your prompt" model1 model2`

### Unified Interface

This repository now includes a unified interface that connects both the bash-based implementation (this repository) and the Python-based implementation (located at `~/ai_framework`):

```bash
# Use the unified launcher
~/ai_framework_git/mirador-unified

# Run a prompt through both implementations
~/ai_framework_git/mirador-unified run "Your prompt here"

# Use specialized modes
~/ai_framework_git/mirador-unified mode dev "Create a function"
```

For more details, see [Unified Interface Documentation](docs/UNIFIED_INTERFACE.md) and [Progress Visualization Documentation](docs/PROGRESS_VISUALIZATION.md).

### Rapid Prototyping

A simplified interface for rapid prototyping that leverages the emergent multi-agent system:

```bash
# Generate ideas with the collaborative multi-agent system
~/ai_framework_git/mirador-rapid "Design a secure user authentication system"
```

This tool focuses on the "accidental brilliance" found in our multi-agent approach, where specialists progressively enhance each other's work.

### Dynamic Specialist Selection

The conductor agent analyzes your task and selects the optimal specialists:

```bash
# Analyze task and select specialists
~/ai_framework_git/mirador-conductor "Create a secure login system in Python"
```

The conductor analyzes your requirements, recommends the most appropriate specialists, and explains its selection rationale.

### Interactive Conversation

The interactive mode provides a conversational interface for refining tasks:

```bash
# Start an interactive session
~/ai_framework_git/mirador-interactive
```

This mode allows you to discuss your task with the conductor, refine it with additional details, and execute the recommended specialist chains.

### Collaborative Communication

The collaborative mode enables specialists to communicate bidirectionally:

```bash
# Run a chain with bidirectional specialist communication
~/ai_framework_git/mirador-collaborate "Create a secure authentication system in Python"

# Run with specific specialists
~/ai_framework_git/mirador-collaborate --specialists master_coder security_expert code_reviewer_fix "Design a database schema for a banking app"

# Run a test to see how it works
~/ai_framework_git/mirador-collaborate --test
```

This powerful mode creates a collaborative multi-agent system where specialists can query each other for information, resulting in more comprehensive and higher-quality outputs.

## Future Enhancements

The Mirador framework continues to evolve with planned enhancements:

### System Architecture
- **Dynamic Agent Selection**: A "conductor" agent to select only relevant specialists ✅
- **Bidirectional Communication**: Allow specialists to request information from each other ✅
- **Knowledge Persistence**: Store specialist outputs for reuse across projects

### Technical Implementation
- **Chain-of-Thought Standardization**: Structured format for reasoning capture
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Measure value added by each specialist
- **Parallel Processing**: Run compatible specialists in parallel

### User Experience
- **Progress Visualization**: Real-time visualization showing specialist contributions ✅
- **Bidirectional Communication**: Specialists can query each other for information ✅
- **Interactive Decision Points**: Allow users to guide the specialist chain ✅
- **Domain-Specific Chains**: Pre-configured specialist sequences for common workflows

These enhancements aim to transform Mirador from a rapid prototyping tool into a comprehensive AI-augmented development platform.

## Ufamily_member Examples

### Running a Basic Chain

```bash
# Guitar practice chain
./scripts/run_chain.sh "Create a practice routine for sweep picking" guitar_expert_precise fast_agent_focused

# Code development chain
./scripts/run_chain.sh "Create a secure authentication system" master_coder code_reviewer_fix

# Business strategy chain
./scripts/run_chain.sh "Develop a marketing plan for a guitar teaching app" llama3.2_balanced creative_entrepreneur
```

### Running a Role-Based Chain for Technical Solutions

The role-based chain is specialized for analyzing code and technical solutions with clearly defined roles:

```bash
# Code review and business application chain
./scripts/run_role_chain.sh "function authenticate(user, pass) { 
  if (user === 'admin' && pass === 'password123') {
    return true;
  }
  return false;
}" master_coder code_reviewer_fix creative_entrepreneur

# Generate documentation and UI for a solution
./scripts/run_role_chain.sh "const fetchUserData = async (userId) => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`);
    return await response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching user data:', error);
    return null;
  }
}" file_reviewer enhanced_agent
```

Available roles and their specializations:
- `creative_entrepreneur`: Identify business applications for the solution
- `enhanced_agent`: Provide comprehensive analysis and insights
