The Terminal window shows a snapshot of several key points in your AI-assistant workflow:

⸻

1. 30-Day Learning Plan Output
	•	You successfully ran the career-chain script and generated a detailed Vue.js & Go learning plan. The Markdown tables and bullet lists look well-structured, indicating that the career_chain_fixed.sh pipeline is working as intended for multi-step prompts.

2. Listing of ~/bin Utilities
	•	The folder contains all the expected helper scripts:

ai-daily
ai-innovate
ai-learn
ai-monetize
ai-recall
ai-reflect
ai-status
analyze-project
fast
financial-ai
learn
personal-ai
work-ai
domain-collab
domain-collab-fixed
…

This confirms that your command aliases and custom utilities are installed in ~/bin. Nothing appears missing or misplaced.

3. Contents of fast
	•	The fast script matches the version we reviewed: it checks for planning-related keywords and, if found, prints the hard-coded daily action plan. Otherwise it falls back to ollama run fast_agent_llama "$*".
	•	Working Optimally: When you ask “Plan my workday,” this prints the static template instantly.
	•	Suboptimal Reminder: The regex (grep -qiE "(plan|priority|focus|today|workday|task)") is still relatively narrow—if you type “priorities” (plural) it won’t match, so it may slip into the fallback. You may want to add “priorities” (and synonyms) to that pattern.

4. enhanced_agent_v2.modelfile
	•	The content is exactly as expected: a system prompt defining an expert analyst persona with a 32 K context window. This model’s presence (roughly 19 GB) shows you’re set up for deep analysis tasks, and ollama ls confirms it’s available as enhanced_agent_v2:latest.

5. Available Ollama Models (ollama ls)
	•	You have multiple local models, including:
	•	fast_agent_ultimate, fast_agent_llama (2 GB each)
	•	enhanced_agent_v2, enhanced_agent (19 GB each)
	•	Other specialty models (e.g., creative_entrepreneur, guitar_expert_precise, my-persistent-agent).
	•	Working Optimally: The key agents for your core workflows are installed (fast_agent_llama and enhanced_agent_v2).
	•	Suboptimal Note: You also have several large models that may not be used regularly (e.g., ux_designer, code_reviewer_fix). Cleaning up unused images could reclaim disk space and reduce clutter when selecting models for new scripts.

6. Head of ai-learn
	•	The first 20 lines confirm that:
	•	DOMAIN defaults to “general” if not set (so if you run ai-learn directly, it will tag entries as general).
	•	The extract_insights function uses ollama run llama3.2_balanced "Extract 1-3 key insights…" and truncates to the first 200 lines.
	•	Working Optimally: Your insight-extraction step is in place.
	•	Suboptimal Reminder: Because get_context isn’t shown or implemented here, queries still ignore past conversations—“enhanced context” isn’t leveraged. Consider adding a snippet to fetch and prepend relevant prior context before building the Llama prompt.

7. Database Operations
	•	You opened ~/ai_memory in Finder and confirmed knowledge.db is about 44 KB—indicating a small, healthy database.
	•	You successfully backed it up with

cp ~/ai_memory/knowledge.db ~/ai_memory/knowledge_backup_20250604_0914.db

which shows your workflow for preserving state.

	•	Working Optimally: The backup command and file inspection are straightforward and correct.

8. Checking for RTF Files
	•	ls -lh /mnt/data/*.rtf returned “no matches found,” confirming that any RTFs you’ve referenced live elsewhere (as you clarified). This is fine since those files are outside this AI system’s directory structure.

9. Disk Ufamily_member & Environment Variables
	•	du -sh ~/ai_memory reports ~228 KB—your memory folder remains lightweight.
	•	env | grep DOMAIN is empty—indicating no DOMAIN variable is currently set. That means if you run ai-learn without a wrapper, it will use the general domain fallback. In practice, always use work-ai, personal-ai, or financial-ai to set DOMAIN explicitly.
	•	Suboptimal Reminder: If you accidentally run ai-learn directly, you may not tag conversations correctly. Consider adding a warning in ai-learn that reminds the user to set a domain or use the domain-specific wrappers.

10. Final ollama list Check
	•	The repeated ollama list verifies all models are still present. It’s a quick sanity check to ensure that none of your key agent images have been deleted or corrupted. Everything required for your agents (fast, enhanced, etc.) is installed and available.

Summary of What’s Working
	1.	Domain wrappers (work-ai / personal-ai / financial-ai) reliably tag and log conversations.
	2.	ai-learn pipeline successfully captures queries, AI responses, and insight extraction.
	3.	ai-daily, ai-innovate, ai-recall, and ai-reflect commands execute as expected, reading from and writing to the SQLite database.
	4.	fast prints an immediate “Today’s Action Plan” template for planning-style queries, bypassing LLM latency.
	5.	Custom models (fast_agent_llama, enhanced_agent_v2) are installed and runnable via ollama run.

Sub-Optimal/Potential Improvements Highlighted by This Snapshot
	•	Regex brittleness in fast (misses certain synonyms).
	•	Unused model images cluttering ollama ls output—some could be removed if not actively used.
	•	ai-learn lacks active get_context use; memory isn’t being prepended to prompts.
	•	Running ai-learn directly tags domain “general” if wrappers aren’t used; consider a reminder or refusal when DOMAIN isn’t explicitly set.
	•	No “ai-show” command exists despite references in ai-recall.
	•	Unused DB fields (tags, contexts) remain unpopulated, signaling functionality gaps.

⸻

Overall, the Terminal window reflects a solid, largely functioning AI-assistant apparatus. Most commands are performing their roles correctly, but a few small tweaks (keyword patterns, context injection, domain-tag warnings, cleaning up unused models) will make the system more robust and eliminate the identified sub-optimal elements.
