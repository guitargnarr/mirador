# Mirador + Claude Integration Decision Matrix

## Executive Summary

This decision matrix provides clear guidance on when to use Mirador's local models, Claude's cloud capabilities, or a hybrid approach based on task requirements, privacy needs, and performance considerations.

## 🎯 Quick Decision Guide

```
Is the query about personal/private data?
├─ YES → Use Mirador (100% local)
└─ NO → Continue to next question

Does it require complex reasoning or code generation?
├─ YES → Does it need personalized context?
│   ├─ YES → Use Hybrid (Mirador context + Claude reasoning)
│   └─ NO → Use Claude API
└─ NO → Use Mirador (faster, cheaper)
```

## 💰 Cost Optimization Strategy

### Volume-Based Routing

```python
def determine_routing(query, monthly_volume):
    if is_private_data(query):
        return "mirador"  # Always local for privacy
    
    if monthly_volume < 1000:
        # Low volume: Optimize for quality
        return "claude" if is_complex(query) else "mirador"
    elif monthly_volume < 10000:
        # Medium volume: Balance cost/quality
        complexity = assess_complexity(query)
        if complexity > 0.7:
            return "hybrid"
        else:
            return "mirador"
    else:
        # High volume: Optimize for cost
        return "mirador" unless requires_claude_capabilities(query)
```

### Cost Calculation Table

| Ufamily_member Pattern | Queries/Month | Mirador Cost | Claude Cost | Hybrid Cost | Recommendation |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| Personal User | <100 | $0 | $1-3 | $0.50-1.50 | Hybrid for best experience |
| Power User | 100-1000 | $0 | $10-30 | $5-15 | Hybrid with smart routing |
| Small Business | 1000-5000 | $0 | $100-150 | $50-75 | Mirador-first with Claude overflow |
| Enterprise | 5000+ | $0 | $500+ | $200-300 | Local infrastructure priority |

## 🚦 Performance Thresholds

### Response Time Requirements

| Requirement | Solution | Configuration |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| <1 second | Mirador V3 streaming | Local models only |
| 1-2 seconds | Hybrid with caching | Mirador context + Claude |
| 2-5 seconds | Claude direct | Full cloud processing |
| >5 seconds | Batch processing | Async Claude with callbacks |

### Quality Thresholds

```python
ROUTING_THRESHOLDS = {
    "code_generation": {
        "min_quality": 0.9,
        "preferred": "claude",
        "fallback": "hybrid"
    },
    "personal_advice": {
        "min_quality": 0.8,
        "preferred": "mirador",
        "fallback": "hybrid"
    },
    "creative_writing": {
        "min_quality": 0.85,
        "preferred": "hybrid",
        "fallback": "claude"
    }
}
```

## 🔒 Security & Privacy Decision Tree

```
Data Classification:
├─ PUBLIC: Can use any system
├─ INTERNAL: Prefer Mirador, Claude with encryption
├─ CONFIDENTIAL: Mirador only, no cloud
└─ RESTRICTED: Mirador with additional security

Compliance Requirements:
├─ GDPR: Local processing required → Mirador
├─ HIPAA: PHI must stay local → Mirador

## 🎯 Decision Validation Checklist

Before implementing your routing decision:

- [ ] **Privacy Check**: Does the query contain personal/sensitive data?
- [ ] **Performance Check**: What's the acceptable response time?
- [ ] **Quality Check**: What's the minimum acceptable quality?
- [ ] **Cost Check**: What's the budget constraint?
- [ ] **Context Check**: Is personalization required?
- [ ] **Compliance Check**: Are there regulatory requirements?

## 📊 Quick Reference Card

### For Developers
```python

def route_query(query, context):
    if has_private_data(query):
        return "mirador"
    
    complexity = assess_complexity(query)
    needs_context = requires_personalization(query)
    
    if complexity > 0.8 and needs_context:
        return "hybrid"

    else:
        return "mirador"
```
