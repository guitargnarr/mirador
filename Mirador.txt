⏺ Mirador: An Orchestrated AI Chaining Framework

Authors: Matthew Scott and Claude AnthropicDate: May 11, 2025

Abstract

This paper presents Mirador, a novel orchestration framework for
chaining specialized AI models into cohesive workflows. Named after
architectural viewpoints that provide panoramic

perspectives, Mirador enables multiple specialized AI models to
collaborate on complex tasks, with each model contributing its unique
expertise to a larger process. Unlike monolithic

approaches that rely on a single large language model, Mirador adopts a
modular architecture where purpose-built models handle specific aspects
of a task, creating results that exceed

what any single model could produce. This paper details Mirador's
architecture, implementation, and capabilities, showcasing how it
addresses fundamental challenges in AI orchestration

through a balance of automation and human oversight. By providing
transparent process visibility, session persistence, and extensible
domain adaptations, Mirador represents a

significant advancement in practical AI system design. The philosophical
underpinnings of Mirador suggest a future direction for AI systems that
favors specialization and collaboration

over generalization, mirroring successful patterns found in human
creative and technical endeavors.

1. Introduction

The development of large language models has led to remarkable
capabilities across numerous domains. However, these models often
represent a compromise between breadth and depth - while

they can perform many tasks adequately, they rarely excel at specialized
functions compared to purpose-built systems. Mirador addresses this
limitation by enabling multiple specialized

AI models to work together on complex tasks, with each model
contributing its expertise within a structured workflow.

Mirador stems from the recognition that the most sophisticated human
endeavors - from software development to creative production - often
involve multiple specialists working in

sequence, with each adding their unique perspective and skills. The
framework implements this principle by orchestrating "personas" - AI
models with specific roles and capabilities - in

configurable chains, with human checkpoints to ensure quality control.

This paper explores the architecture, implementation, and capabilities
of Mirador, focusing on its practical applications in software
development, creative work, and specialized domains

such as guitar technique analysis. We demonstrate how Mirador's modular
approach enables more sophisticated AI applications compared to
single-model approaches, while maintaining human

oversight at critical junctures.

2. Technical Foundation

2.1 Architecture Overview

Mirador's architecture consists of four primary components:

1. Core Framework: The central orchestration system that manages the
flow between AI models

2. Persona System: Configurable AI roles with specific functions (e.g.,
master_coder, code_reviewer)

3. Session Management: Persistent storage of execution history with
resumability

4. API Layer: RESTful interface for remote access and integration

At its core, Mirador is built around the concept of a processing chain -
a sequence of specialized AI models (personas) that process content
iteratively, with each model building upon

the output of the previous one. Figure 1 illustrates this architecture.

2.2 Persona System

The persona system is the foundation of Mirador's specialization
approach. Each persona represents a specialized AI model configured for
a specific role in the processing chain.

Personas are defined with:

- A unique identifier (e.g., master_coder)

- An associated Ollama model (e.g., master-coder:latest)

- A role description (e.g., "Generate baseline implementation")

- A prompt template that structures how input is presented to the model

This configuration-driven approach allows for the flexible definition of
roles without requiring code changes. New personas can be added by
defining their parameters in the

configuration file.

2.3 Session Management

Mirador implements robust session management to maintain context across
runs and enable process resumption. Each execution session is assigned a
unique identifier (typically a

timestamp) and maintains:

- Inputs and outputs for each persona in the chain

- Execution timing information

- Process metadata

- A summary of the entire execution

This persistent session storage enables users to:

- Resume interrupted processing

- Review previous outputs

- Continue processing with modified inputs

- Track progress across multiple iterations

2.4 API Layer

The API layer exposes Mirador's functionality through a RESTful
interface, enabling:

- Remote execution of chains

- Individual persona invocation

- Session management and retrieval

- Configuration access

This layer transforms Mirador from a command-line utility to a service
that can be integrated with other applications, extending its reach
beyond direct terminal interaction.

3. Implementation

3.1 Core Framework

The heart of Mirador is its framework.py module, which implements the
AIFramework class responsible for orchestrating the entire process. The
implementation focuses on:

- Chain execution management

- Persona invocation with appropriate context

- Session persistence

- Error handling and recovery

- Human interaction points

The framework uses a streaming approach to model interaction, providing
real-time feedback during execution rather than waiting for complete
responses. This enables more responsive user

experiences, especially with longer-running processes.

def run_chain(self, input_text, start_at=None, end_at=None,
interactive=True,

persona_parameters=None, skip_optional=False, continue_on_error=False):

"""

Run the complete chain or a segment of it.

Args:

input_text (str): The input text to process

start_at (str, optional): Persona ID to start at

end_at (str, optional): Persona ID to end at

interactive (bool): Whether to run in interactive mode with user prompts

persona_parameters (dict, optional): Dict mapping persona IDs to
parameter dicts

skip_optional (bool): Whether to automatically skip optional nodes

continue_on_error (bool): Whether to continue chain execution on errors

Returns:

dict: Dictionary of outputs from each persona

"""

3.2 Model Specialization

Mirador leverages Ollama's model customization capabilities through
modelfiles, which define specialized versions of base models like Llama3
and DeepSeek. These specializations include:

FROM llama3

PARAMETER num_ctx 8192

PARAMETER num_gpu 99

PARAMETER num_thread 12

PARAMETER temperature 0.7

SYSTEM """You are a world-class Python developer with expertise in
efficient algorithms and data structures. Your task is to generate
clean, working code implementations based on

requirements. Focus on:

1. Correctness - code should work as expected

2. Efficiency - optimize for speed and resource ufamily_member

3. Readability - clear variable names and structure

4. Error handling - proper validation and exception management

5. Standards compliance - follow PEP 8 guidelines

Your code should be complete and runnable. Include docstrings and
comments where appropriate. Do not use placeholder code - implement full
solutions."""

Example modelfile for master-coder persona

Each persona's modelfile is carefully crafted to enhance specific
capabilities, using:

- Appropriate context window sizes

- Optimized parameters for the specific task

- Detailed system prompts that focus the model on its specialized role

- Task-specific examples and guidelines

3.3 Session Persistence

Mirador implements session persistence through a hierarchical file
structure:

ai_framework/

├── outputs/

│ ├── 20250511-133327/

│ │ ├── initial_input.txt

│ │ ├── master_coder_input.txt

│ │ ├── master_coder_output.txt

│ │ ├── code_reviewer_input.txt

│ │ ├── code_reviewer_output.txt

│ │ └── summary.md

This structure enables:

- Complete traceability of the execution process

- Simple inspection of intermediate outputs

- Recovery from interruptions

- Analysis of performance and results

3.4 API Implementation

The API is implemented using Flask, providing endpoints for:

- Chain execution (/api/run)

- Individual persona execution (/api/run/{persona_id})

- Session listing (/api/sessions)

- Session details (/api/sessions/{session_id})

- Output retrieval (/api/sessions/{session_id}/outputs/{persona_id})

- Configuration access (/api/personas)

The API layer maintains consistency with the command-line interface
while enabling remote and programmatic access.

4. Mirador in Action: Case Studies

4.1 Code Generation and Improvement

The primary case study demonstrating Mirador's capabilities involves
generating, enhancing, and documenting a Python function to calculate
Fibonacci numbers. This case study showcases

the full chain execution with all specialized personas.

Initial Prompt

Create a Python function to calculate the Fibonacci sequence

Master Coder Output

The master-coder persona generated a baseline implementation with proper
documentation and error handling:

def fibonacci(n):

"""

Calculate the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.

Args:

n (int): The position of the number in the sequence.

Returns:

int: The nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.

"""

if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 0:

raise ValueError("n must be a non-negative integer")

if n <= 1:

return n

a, b = 0, 1

for _ in range(2, n + 1):

a, b = b, a + b

return b

Code Reviewer Enhancement

The code-reviewer persona identified potential issues with large values
and enhanced the implementation:

def fibonacci(n):

"""

Calculate the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.

Args:

n (int): The position of the number in the sequence.

Returns:

int: The nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.

"""

if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 0:

raise ValueError("n must be a non-negative integer")

if n <= 1:

return n

a, b = 0, 1

for _ in range(2, min(n + 1, 92)):

a, b = b, a + b

return b

Note the addition of min(n + 1, 92) to handle Python's integer limits.

File Reviewer Documentation

The file-reviewer persona provided comprehensive documentation and ufamily_member
explanation:

Summary: This code calculates and returns the nth number in the
Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where
each subsequent number is the sum of the previous

two, starting from 0 and 1.

Purpose and Utility: The purpose of this code is to provide an efficient
way to calculate Fibonacci numbers up to a certain position (n). This
can be useful in various applications such

as mathematics, finance, or computer science.

Creative Applications

The creative-entrepreneur persona identified multiple real-world
applications:

1. Financial Trading Tool: Calculating Fibonacci retracement levels for
technical analysis

2. Procedural Content Generation: Creating natural patterns in gaming
environments

3. Educational Math Tools: Visualizing mathematical sequences and
patterns

4. Music Composition: Generating compositions based on mathematical
patterns

5. Botanical Growth Modeling: Simulating natural growth patterns in
plants

User Interface Design

The ux-designer persona proposed both CLI and GUI implementations:

# GUI Implementation

import tkinter as tk

from tkinter import ttk, mesfamily_memberbox

def fibonacci(n):

# Implementation...

def main():

root = tk.Tk()

root.title("Fibonacci Calculator")

# UI implementation details...

root.mainloop()

if __name__ == "__main__":

main()

This case study demonstrates how Mirador transforms a simple request
into a comprehensive solution with implementation, optimization,
documentation, application ideas, and user

interface design - each aspect handled by a specialized model.

4.2 Guitar Technique Analysis

Another notable case study involves Mirador's domain-specific
application for guitar technique analysis, showcasing the framework's
adaptability to specialized knowledge domains.

The guitar-expert persona demonstrated detailed knowledge of guitar
techniques, providing:

Economy picking is a technique that enhances guitar playing efficiency
by combining downstrokes, upstrokes, and finger techniques to minimize
pick hand movement. Here's an organized

overview:

### What is Economy Picking?

- **Definition**: A method where guitarists use the most efficient
strokes for each note, often using consecutive downstrokes or upstrokes
when beneficial.

- **Differentiation from Sweep Picking**: Unlike sweep picking, which
involves sweeping across multiple strings in one stroke, economy picking
focuses on efficiency within individual

phrases.

### Applications in Technical Death Metal

- **Ufamily_member**: Commonly used in fast riffs and solos where quick
transitions between notes are essential. It allows for smoother
execution of complex patterns without the constraints of

alternate picking.

- **Integration with Other Techniques**: Can be combined with tapping,
hammer-ons, or pull-offs to create intricate and fluid pasfamily_members.

This example demonstrates how Mirador can be extended to highly
specialized domains beyond general software development, leveraging
domain-specific models to provide expert-level

guidance.

5. Command-Line Interface Examples

Mirador provides a flexible command-line interface that supports various
ufamily_member patterns. Table 1 presents a comprehensive overview of command
examples and their applications.

Table 1: Mirador Command-Line Interface Examples

For more advanced use cases:

# Run a chain with specific persona parameters

cat <<EOF > params.json

{

"master_coder": {

"temperature": 0.5,

"top_p": 0.9

},

"code_reviewer": {

"temperature": 0.3

}

}

EOF

python3 -m ai_framework.framework --prompt "Implement a binary search
tree" --parameters params.json

# Process a large document with domain-specific analysis

python3 -m ai_framework.framework --file /path/to/research_paper.txt
--start rag_node --end creative_entrepreneur

These examples demonstrate the flexibility and power of Mirador's
command-line interface, enabling both simple and complex workflows.

6. Development Journey

The development of Mirador represents a collaborative journey between
human creativity and AI assistance. This section explores the key
moments and interactions that transformed an

initial concept into a robust framework.

6.1 Genesis

Mirador began as Matthew Scott's vision for a system that could chain
specialized AI models together. The initial implementation was focused
on the core functionality - executing a

sequence of models with human checkpoints - but lacked some of the more
sophisticated features like comprehensive session management and API
access.

The project was born out of a recognition that while large language
models excel at many tasks, truly exceptional results often require
specialized expertise. By combining purpose-built

models in a structured workflow, Mirador aimed to achieve results beyond
what any single model could produce.

6.2 Pivotal Interactions

Several key moments defined the collaborative development process:

1. Framework Enhancement: The foundational enhancement to the
AIFramework class added robust session management, enabling users to
resume work and maintain context across sessions.

2. API Development: The creation of a RESTful API interface transformed
Mirador from a command-line tool to a service that could be integrated
with other applications.

3. Guitar Studio Implementation: The development of a domain-specific
extension demonstrated Mirador's adaptability to specialized knowledge
domains beyond software developm
