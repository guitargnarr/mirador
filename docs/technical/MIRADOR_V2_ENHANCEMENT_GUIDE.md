## 🔄 **The Learning Loop**

```
Query → Context Loading → Enhanced Execution → Format Selection
   ↑                                                      ↓
Feedback → Pattern Learning ← Constraint Validation ← Output
```

### **How the System Gets Smarter:**

1. **Initial Run**: Standard context-aware recommendations
2. **Feedback Collection**: You rate the helpfulness (1-5 stars)  
3. **Pattern Extraction**: System identifies what worked well
4. **Context Caching**: Successful patterns stored for future use
5. **Improved Recommendations**: Next runs incorporate learned patterns

## 💡 **Advanced Usage Patterns**

### **Morning Planning Session**
```bash
# Quick daily plan
./mirador_universal_runner_v2.sh life_optimization "Today's priorities: work, Child, Partner, coursework" quick

# Validate the plan
python3 constraint_validator.py validate outputs/latest/summary.md

# Rate the result
./mirador_feedback.sh TIMESTAMP 5 "Perfect morning structure"
```

### **Weekly Strategic Review**
```bash
# Comprehensive analysis
./mirador_universal_runner_v2.sh strategic_synthesis "Week ahead: balance innovation, relationships, education" detailed

# Get context from previous weeks
python3 context_manager.py context strategic_synthesis "weekly planning"
```

### **Quick Decision Making**
```bash
# Immediate actionable insights
./mirador_universal_runner_v2.sh business_acceleration "Should I prioritize patent filing or prototype development?" quick

# Export for further analysis
./mirador_universal_runner_v2.sh technical_mastery "Architecture decision for Mirador scaling" export
```

---

## 📈 **Performance Tracking**

### **Built-in Analytics**

```bash
# View feedback trends
python3 context_manager.py stats

# Check constraint patterns
python3 constraint_validator.py summary

# Review session history
ls -la outputs/universal_*/ | tail -10
```

### **ROI Measurement**
- Track time saved through feedback system
- Monitor constraint adherence improvement
- Measure decision speed enhancement
- Analyze pattern learning effectiveness

---

## 🎛️ **Configuration & Personalization**

### **Constraint Customization**
Edit `constraint_validator.py` to adjust:
- Available personal hours (default: 9 hours)
- Energy capacity levels (default: 10-point scale)
- Financial constraints (default: modest income income)
- Priority activity definitions

### **Context Pattern Tuning**
- High-rated sessions automatically become patterns
- Manual pattern injection via context cache files
- Pattern weighting based on recency and success
- Domain-specific pattern libraries

### **Format Preferences**
- Set default format per chain type
- Custom format definitions
- Integration export templates
- Output post-processing rules

---

## 🔧 **Integration with Existing Tools**

### **Productivity Apps**
```bash
# Export to Notion/Obsidian
./mirador_universal_runner_v2.sh life_optimization "Weekly planning" export
# Then import the JSON output

# Calendar integration
grep -o '\d\+\.\?\d* hours' outputs/latest/summary.md
```

### **Development Workflow**
```bash
# Quick technical decisions
./mirador_universal_runner_v2.sh technical_mastery "API design choice" quick

# Validate time estimates
python3 constraint_validator.py validate project_timeline.md
```

### **Relationship Management**
```bash
# Quick relationship check-ins
./mirador_universal_runner_v2.sh relationship_harmony "Partner conversation topics" quick

# Weekly relationship planning
./mirador_universal_runner_v2.sh relationship_harmony "Family time optimization" summary
```

---

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

**Models not found:**
```bash
ollama list  # Check available models
# Ensure user_context_provider_v5_complete, practical_implementer, etc. exist
```

**Constraint validation errors:**
```bash
python3 constraint_validator.py test  # Run built-in test
# Adjust parameters if needed for your specific constraints
```

**Context cache not loading:**
```bash
ls -la ~/.mirador/context_cache/  # Check cache directory
python3 context_manager.py stats  # Verify database
```

### **Performance Optimization**

**Speed up execution:**
- Use `quick` format for faster responses
- Clear old context cache: `python3 context_manager.py cleanup`
- Limit model sequence for simple queries

**Improve recommendations:**
- Provide consistent feedback ratings
- Use specific prompts rather than general questions
- Review and rate outputs to build pattern library
