# 🚀 Mirador Model Optimization Strategy

## Executive Summary

Based on analysis of your current Ollama configuration and test results, I'll provide comprehensive recommendations to:
1. **Optimize models for quality over speed** with Apple Silicon Metal acceleration
2. **Refocus Mirador** from Company-specific to truly multi-faceted
3. **Update model context** based on our conversation about Matthew's real profile

## 🔧 Current Model Configuration Analysis

### **Discovered Issues:**
- **Outdated Context**: Models still reference Louisville/Company context
- **Speed-Optimized Settings**: Temperature 0.3, limited parameters
- **Limited Tokens**: num_predict 800 (too restrictive)
- **Generic Template**: Using standard Llama 3.2 template

### **Current matthew_context_provider_v3 Analysis:**
```
