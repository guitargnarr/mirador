# Mirador Actionable System: Complete Implementation Package

## Quick Start Commands

Execute these commands in order to deploy your actionable Mirador system:

```bash
# 1. Navigate to your Mirador directory
cd ~/ai_framework_git

# 2. Ensure Ollama is running
brew services restart ollama
sleep 10
ollama pull llama3.2_balanced

# 3. Create the new specialist models
# Copy the modelfiles from the provided files and create each model:
ollama create opportunity_identification_specialist -f opportunity_identification_specialist.modelfile
ollama create instruction_generation_specialist -f instruction_generation_specialist.modelfile
ollama create fact_validation_specialist -f fact_validation_specialist.modelfile

# 4. Deploy the enhanced systems
chmod +x mirador_actionable.py
chmod +x mirador_fact_validator.py
chmod +x mirador_action_prioritizer.py

# 5. Create global commands
sudo cp mirador-action /usr/local/bin/
sudo cp mirador-validate /usr/local/bin/
sudo cp mirador-priority /usr/local/bin/

# 6. Test the complete system
mirador-action generate
mirador-action show
mirador-priority top
```

## Daily Workflow

### Morning (5 minutes)
```bash
# Generate today's high-value action
mirador-action generate

# Review the action
mirador-action show

# Check priority opportunities
mirador-priority top --limit 3
```

### Execution (Variable)
```bash
# Start action tracking
mirador-priority start [opportunity_id] --energy [1-10] --mood "[description]"

# Follow the generated instructions
# Execute the specific steps provided
```

### Evening (5 minutes)
```bash
# Complete action tracking
mirador-priority complete [opportunity_id] \
  --duration [actual_minutes] \
  --satisfaction [1-10] \
  --savings [amount_saved] \
  --income [amount_earned] \
  --cost [amount_spent] \
  --notes "[outcome_description]"

# Review performance
mirador-priority performance --days 7
```

## Key Features Delivered

### 1. Opportunity Identification
- Scans your situation for immediate actionable opportunities
- Focuses on 24-48 hour execution timeframe
- Prioritizes Louisville-specific resources and advantages
- Identifies financial optimization, efficiency improvements, and strategic opportunities

### 2. Instruction Generation
- Converts opportunities into specific, executable instructions
- Provides step-by-step guidance with exact details
- Specifies resource requirements and success criteria
- Includes verification checkpoints and backup options

### 3. Fact Validation
- Verifies all factual claims in instructions
- Cross-references multiple authoritative sources
- Provides confidence scoring and validation reports
- Flags outdated or questionable information

### 4. Priority Scoring
- Evaluates opportunities across 6 dimensions:
  - Financial Impact (30%)
  - Time Efficiency (20%)
  - Strategic Value (20%)
  - Feasibility (15%)
  - Urgency (10%)
  - Learning Value (5%)

### 5. Outcome Tracking
- Monitors execution success and value realization
- Tracks time investment and satisfaction ratings
- Builds historical performance database
- Enables continuous system improvement

## Expected Outcomes

### Week 1
- System generating daily actionable instructions
- Instructions completing in estimated timeframes
- Fact validation providing confidence scores above 70%
- At least 5 successful action completions

### Month 1
- Average instruction value of $50+ per action
- 80%+ completion rate for generated instructions
- Identification of 3+ high-value optimization opportunities
- Measurable time savings through systematic approach

### Quarter 1
- Cumulative value delivery of $500+ through executed actions
- System learning from outcomes and improving recommendations
- Integration into daily routine with minimal overhead
- Discovery of opportunities not obvious through manual analysis

## Success Validation

The system is working effectively when you experience:

1. **Daily Value Delivery**: Each instruction provides clear, measurable value
2. **Execution Confidence**: Instructions are specific enough to execute without hesitation
3. **Fact Reliability**: Validation catches inaccuracies before execution
4. **Time Efficiency**: Value generated exceeds time invested
5. **Continuous Improvement**: System learns from outcomes and improves over time

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Models not responding:**
```bash
brew services restart ollama
sleep 10
ollama list
```

**Database errors:**
```bash
cd ~/ai_framework_git
rm -f *.db
mirador-action generate  # Reinitializes databases
```

**Validation failures:**
- Check internet connection
- Verify source websites are accessible
- Review validation confidence scores before execution

**Low-quality instructions:**
- Provide more specific context in generation
- Use `--context` parameter to guide opportunity identification
- Review and complete outcome tracking to improve learning

## File Structure

Your enhanced Mirador system includes:

```

## Support and Optimization

### Performance Monitoring
```bash
# Check system health
mirador-priority performance --days 30

# Review recent actions
mirador-priority history --days 7
