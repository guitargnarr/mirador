# 🚀 MIRADOR AI Framework

> **M**ulti-model **I**ntelligent **R**esponse **A**rchitecture for **D**ynamic **O**rchestrated **R**easoning

MIRADOR is an advanced AI orchestration framework that enables sophisticated multi-model chains, allowing different AI specialists to collaborate on complex tasks. Think of it as conducting an orchestra of AI models, where each musician (model) contributes their unique expertise to create a harmonious solution.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **🎭 Multi-Model Orchestration**: Chain multiple AI models together for comprehensive solutions
- **🤖 17 Specialized Models**: From code generation to business strategy to music theory
- **🔗 Intelligent Handoffs**: Each model builds upon the previous model's output
- **📊 Automatic Categorization**: Outputs are organized by type (technical, business, creative, etc.)
- **💾 Persistent Results**: All outputs saved with detailed contribution tracking
- **🚀 Global Access**: Use from anywhere with the `mirador-ez` command

## 🎯 What Makes MIRADOR Special?

Unlike single-model AI interactions, MIRADOR enables:
- **Specialist Collaboration**: A code expert can hand off to a business strategist
- **Emergent Solutions**: Chains often produce insights beyond individual model capabilities  
- **Quality Iteration**: Code can be generated, reviewed, and optimized in one flow
- **Cross-Domain Synthesis**: Combine technical, creative, and strategic thinking
