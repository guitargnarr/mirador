## Advanced Configuration Options

Beyond the basic installation and setup procedures, the optimized Mirador system provides extensive configuration options that enable users to customize system behavior for specific use cases, performance requirements, and operational preferences. Understanding these advanced configuration options allows users to maximize the value they receive from the system while ensuring optimal performance for their particular environment and workflows.

### Performance Tuning

Performance tuning represents one of the most impactful areas for advanced configuration, as proper tuning can significantly improve response times, resource utilization, and overall system efficiency. The optimized Mirador system provides multiple levels of performance configuration that can be adjusted based on available hardware resources, ufamily_member patterns, and performance requirements.

Memory management configuration controls how the system allocates and manages memory resources for model loading, caching, and general operation. Users with abundant memory can configure the system to keep multiple models loaded simultaneously, reducing startup delays for frequently used models. Conversely, users with limited memory can configure more aggressive memory management that dynamically loads and unloads models based on immediate needs.

The memory configuration includes settings for maximum concurrent model loading, which determines how many models can be loaded simultaneously without causing resource exhaustion. This setting should be adjusted based on available system memory and the typical memory requirements of the models being used. Additionally, memory threshold settings control when the system begins unloading less frequently used models to free memory for new operations.

Cache configuration provides another significant opportunity for performance optimization, as intelligent caching can dramatically reduce response times for frequently requested analyses. The cache system includes settings for maximum cache size, cache retention policies, and cache invalidation strategies that can be tuned based on available storage space and ufamily_member patterns.

Cache size limits determine how much disk space the system dedicates to storing cached responses. Users with abundant storage can configure larger cache sizes to maximize cache hit rates, while users with limited storage can configure smaller caches with more aggressive cleanup policies. The cache retention policies determine how long cached responses remain valid before being automatically invalidated and removed.

Timeout and retry configuration enables users to balance system responsiveness with reliability based on their specific use cases and tolerance for delays. Users who prioritize speed can configure shorter timeouts and fewer retry attempts, accepting occasional failures in exchange for faster overall response times. Users who prioritize reliability can configure longer timeouts and more retry attempts to maximize the likelihood of successful operation even under challenging conditions.

### Integration Configuration

Integration configuration enables the Mirador system to work effectively with external tools, services, and workflows that users may already have established. Proper integration configuration can significantly enhance productivity by enabling seamless data flow between Mirador and other systems while maintaining the privacy and security benefits of local operation.

Version control integration allows the Mirador system to automatically track changes to configurations, model definitions, and important outputs using Git or other version control systems. This integration provides valuable capabilities for tracking system evolution, collaborating with others, and maintaining backup copies of important configurations and data.

The version control configuration includes settings for automatic commit policies, which determine when the system automatically creates commits for configuration changes or important outputs. Users can configure the system to automatically commit daily summaries, significant configuration changes, or important analysis results, ensuring that valuable work is preserved and tracked over time.

Backup integration enables the system to automatically create and maintain backups of critical data, configurations, and outputs using external backup services or local backup solutions. This integration provides essential data protection capabilities while maintaining the privacy benefits of local operation.

Backup configuration includes settings for backup frequency, retention policies, and backup destinations. Users can configure daily, weekly, or monthly backup schedules based on their data protection requirements and available backup infrastructure. The retention policies determine how long backup copies are maintained before being automatically deleted to manage storage requirements.

Monitoring integration allows the system to work with external monitoring tools and services to provide comprehensive visibility into system operation, performance trends, and potential issues. This integration can be particularly valuable for users who manage multiple systems or who require detailed operational reporting.
