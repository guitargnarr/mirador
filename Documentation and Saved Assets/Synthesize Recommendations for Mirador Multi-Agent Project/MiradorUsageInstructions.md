# Mirador Ufamily_member Instructions

## Getting Started

### First-Time Setup

#### 1. System Verification
Before using Mirador, verify your system is properly configured:

```bash
# Check Ollama service
brew services list | grep ollama

# Verify Python environment
source google-env/bin/activate
python --version

# Test system health
./system_validation.sh
```

#### 2. Model Verification
Ensure all required models are installed and functional:

```bash
# List installed models
ollama list

# Test core models
mirador-ez ask decision_simplifier "Test mesfamily_member"
mirador-ez ask mirador_system_specialist "System status check"
```

#### 3. Initial Configuration
Set up your personal context and preferences:

```bash
# Update personal context
mirador-ez ask matthew_context_provider "Update my current situation: [describe your current professional status, goals, and priorities]"

# Test personalized response
mirador-ez chain "What should be my top priority today?" \
  matthew_context_provider decision_simplifier
```
