- Establishes proper directory structure and permissions

### Key Commands You'll Execute:
```bash
# Foundation setup
cd ~
mkdir -p ai_framework_git/{outputs,models,scripts,backups,logs}

# Enhanced core engine installation
cat > mirador.py << 'EOF'
[Complete enhanced Python script]
EOF

# Global command installation
cat > mirador-ez << 'EOF'
[Enhanced command interface]
EOF
```

### Success Indicators:
- ✅ `mirador-ez health` shows all systems operational
- ✅ `mirador-ez models` lists available models
- ✅ `mirador-ez presets` shows all 50+ chain prompts
- ✅ No hanging commands when testing

## **Phase 3: Testing and Optimization**
**Document:** Enhanced Mirador Implementation with Troubleshooting  
**Time Required:** 10-15 minutes  
**Purpose:** Verify system operation and optimize performance

### What This Phase Does:
- Tests all major system components
- Verifies chain prompt integration
- Optimizes performance settings
- Establishes monitoring and maintenance procedures

### Key Tests to Perform:
```bash
# Test basic functionality
mirador-ez quick priorities

# Test preset chains
mirador-ez preset career_strategy

# Test auto-selection
mirador-ez auto "Help me improve my guitar skills"

# Test manual chains
mirador-ez chain "Plan my practice routine" master_guitar_instructor decision_simplifier
```

### Success Indicators:
- ✅ All test commands complete without hanging
- ✅ Outputs are relevant and actionable
- ✅ System responds within expected timeframes
- ✅ No error mesfamily_members in logs

## **Phase 4: Reference and Maintenance Setup**
**Document:** Comprehensive Troubleshooting and Optimization Guide  
**Time Required:** 5-10 minutes (initial setup)  
**Purpose:** Establish ongoing maintenance and optimization procedures

### What This Phase Does:
- Sets up daily, weekly, and monthly maintenance routines
- Establishes performance monitoring
- Provides troubleshooting procedures for any future issues
- Creates optimization strategies for continued improvement

### Key Setup Actions:

## **🚀 Quick Start After Installation**

Once you complete Phase 1-3, start with these commands to experience the full system:

### **Daily Operations:**
```bash
mirador-ez quick priorities          # Set daily priorities
mirador-ez quick practice --time "1 hour"  # Optimize practice session
mirador-ez quick review             # Evening review
```

### **Career Development:**
```bash
mirador-ez preset career_strategy    # Comprehensive career planning
mirador-ez preset skill_assessment   # Guitar skill evaluation
mirador-ez preset networking_strategy # Industry networking plan
```

### **Auto-Intelligence:**
```bash
mirador-ez auto "I need financial advice for my music career transition"
mirador-ez auto "How can I improve my stage presence and performance confidence?"
