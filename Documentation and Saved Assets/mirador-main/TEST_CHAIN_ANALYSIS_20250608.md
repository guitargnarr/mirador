Based on your request, I'll provide a 12-month roadmap for transitioning from full-time employment to consulting while maintaining income stability.
Assuming an exact income amount is provided (e.g., "$XX,XXX"), here's a 12-month roadmap to help you transition from full-time employment to consulting while maintaining income stability:
* Begin moonlighting by offering services on a part-time basis (e.g., 10-20 hours/week) to build your network, gain experience, and establish a reputation.
* Create a financial safety net by saving 3-6 months' worth of living expenses in an easily accessible savings account (e.g., high-yield savings or money market fund).
* Gradually increase your moonlighting hours to 40-50 hours/week, allowing you to scale up your consulting business.
* 3 months' worth of living expenses (e.g., $22,500 for a $XX,XXX income)
The previous 12-month roadmap provided a comprehensive plan for transitioning from full-time employment to consulting while maintaining income stability. The key takeaways include:
* Client pipeline development through online presence, networking events, and word-of-mouth promotion (Months 4-6)
