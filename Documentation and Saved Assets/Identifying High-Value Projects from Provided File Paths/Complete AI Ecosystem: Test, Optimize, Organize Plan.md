**Medium Priority:**
- [ ] Populate unused database fields (tags, confidence)
- [ ] Add domain validation and warnings
- [ ] Improve output formatting for ai-daily
- [ ] Clean up unused Ollama models
- [ ] Add feedback loop tracking

### 3.2 Performance Optimization
- [ ] Optimize model selection for different tasks
- [ ] Improve database query performance
- [ ] Reduce redundant model loading
