## Ufamily_member Patterns

### Code Development Workflow
```bash
# 1. Initial code generation
./mirador chain "Create a user authentication system in Python" --models master_coder

# 2. Security review and improvements
./mirador chain "Review and improve this authentication code: [code]" --models code_reviewer_fix

# 3. Documentation generation
./mirador chain "Document this authentication system" --models file_reviewer

# 4. Business application analysis
./mirador chain "Identify business applications for this auth system" --models creative_entrepreneur
```

### Business Analysis Workflow
```bash
# 1. Market analysis
./mirador-conductor "Analyze the market for AI productivity tools"

# 2. Product ideation
./mirador-collaborate "Develop product concepts for identified market opportunities"

# 3. Business model development
./mirador chain "Create business models for these product concepts" --models creative_entrepreneur enhanced_agent
```

### Interactive Development
```bash
# Start interactive session
./mirador-interactive

# Example conversation flow:
User: "I want to build a guitar learning app"
Conductor: "I recommend starting with UX design, then technical architecture..."
User: "Focus on the practice tracking features first"
Conductor: "Let me connect you with the UX designer and data specialist..."
```

## Advanced Features

### Chain Templates
Pre-configured specialist sequences for common workflows:

```bash
# Code development chain
./mirador template code "Build a REST API"

# Business analysis chain  
./mirador template business "Evaluate market opportunity"

# Creative development chain
./mirador template creative "Design user experience"
```

### Custom Model Configuration
Modify `config.json` to customize model behavior:

```json
{
  "models": {
    "custom_specialist": {
      "temperature": 0.5,
      "context_length": 4096,
      "description": "Custom specialist for specific domain"
    }
  }
}
```

### Output Management
Results are automatically organized in the `outputs/` directory:

```
outputs/
├── chains/           # Chain execution results
├── conversations/    # Interactive session logs
├── collaborate/      # Collaboration session results
└── reports/         # Generated analysis reports
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Command not found"
```bash
# Make sure commands are executable
chmod +x mirador*

# Check if you're in the correct directory
ls -la mirador*
```

#### "Python import errors"
```bash
# Run the optimization script
./optimize_system.sh

# Verify Python environment
python3 -c "import requests, json; print('Dependencies OK')"
```

#### "Ollama connection failed"
```bash
# Check if Ollama is running
curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags

# Start Ollama if needed
ollama serve
```

#### "Configuration errors"
```bash
# Validate configuration
jq empty config.json

# Reset to default configuration
./optimize_system.sh
```

### Health Monitoring
Regular system health checks:

```bash
# Run comprehensive health check
./health_check.py

# Run full test suite
./test_suite.sh

# Check system logs
tail -f logs/system.log
```

## Best Practices

### Model Selection
- **fast_agent**: Quick factual queries, simple tasks
- **enhanced_agent**: Complex analysis, research tasks
- **master_coder**: Code generation, programming tasks
- **code_reviewer_fix**: Security analysis, code review
- **creative_entrepreneur**: Business analysis, innovation
- **guitar_expert_precise**: Music-related tasks

### Chain Design
- Start with conductor analysis for optimal specialist selection
- Use bidirectional collaboration for complex multi-domain tasks
- Include human intervention points for critical decisions
- Document and save successful chain patterns as templates

### Performance Optimization
- Use appropriate temperature settings for each task type
- Monitor chain execution times and optimize bottlenecks
- Regularly update model configurations based on ufamily_member patterns
- Maintain clean output directories to prevent storage issues

## Integration with Existing Workflows

### Shell Integration
Add to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:

```bash
# Mirador aliases
alias m='./mirador'
alias mc='./mirador-conductor'
alias mi='./mirador-interactive'
alias mr='./mirador-rapid'

# Quick functions
mirador_code() {
    ./mirador chain "$1" --models master_coder code_reviewer_fix
}

mirador_business() {
    ./mirador chain "$1" --models creative_entrepreneur enhanced_agent
}
```

### IDE Integration
Configure your IDE to use Mirador for:
- Code review and suggestions
- Documentation generation
- Architecture analysis
- Business requirement analysis

### Automation Scripts
Create automated workflows:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Daily development workflow
./mirador-conductor "Review today's development priorities"
./mirador-collaborate "Analyze current project status and next steps"
./health_check.py
```

This user guide provides comprehensive coverage of the Mirador framework's capabilities and ufamily_member patterns. The system is designed to be both powerful for advanced users and accessible for newcomers to AI-assisted development workflows.
