6. Miscellaneous:

Total Monthly Expenses: $13,334

**Revenue Projections:**

Assuming an average sale of $15 per customer and a daily capacity of 50 customers, the revenue projections are:

Year 1:

* Average monthly sales: $60,000
* Revenue growth rate: 10%

Year 2:

* Average monthly sales: $66,000 (10% increase from Year 1)
* Revenue growth rate: 5%

Year 3:

* Average monthly sales: $69,900 (5% increase from Year 2)

**Break-Even Analysis:**

Assuming a startup cost of $152,000 and a monthly expense of $13,334, the break-even analysis is:

* Break-even point: approximately 11 months after opening
* Revenue required to break even: $1,732,000 (assuming 12 months x $13,334/month)

**Louisville Market Rates:**

Based on Louisville market rates, here are some assumptions for pricing and revenue projections:

* Average entree price: $10-$15
* Average drink price: $3-$5
* Average dessert price: $5-$7

Assuming an average sale of $15 per customer, the revenue projections are based on a 20% profit margin.

**Local Resources and Opportunities:**

1. Louisville Metro:
	* Food truck permits and licenses can be obtained through the City of Louisville's Business License Office.
2. JCPS:
	* Food trucks may be allowed in school zones with proper permits and approvals.

2. Obtain necessary licenses and permits from the City of Louisville and Jefferson County.
3. Purchase or lease a food truck that meets local health and safety regulations.
4. Develop a marketing strategy to attract customers and build brand awareness.
