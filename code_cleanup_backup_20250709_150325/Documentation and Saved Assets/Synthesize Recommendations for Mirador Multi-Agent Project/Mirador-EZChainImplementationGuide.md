## Complete Implementation Guide for Mirador Chain Prompt Suite

This implementation guide provides everything you need to immediately begin using the comprehensive Mirador chain prompt suite for music career development and personal growth. The guide includes ready-to-use terminal commands, troubleshooting solutions for the hanging command issue, and systematic approaches to maximizing the value of your Mirador AI orchestration system.

## Immediate Setup and Configuration

### Enhanced Command Interface Installation

First, let's install the enhanced command interface that resolves the hanging "ask" command issue and provides improved functionality:

```bash
# Create the enhanced mirador-ez command with timeout and interrupt handling
cat << 'EOF' > ~/mirador-ez-enhanced
#!/bin/bash

# Enhanced Mirador-EZ with timeout handling and graceful interruption
# Resolves hanging command issues and provides better user experience

set -euo pipefail

MIRADOR_DIR="${MIRADOR_DIR:-$HOME/mirador}"
TIMEOUT_DURATION="${MIRADOR_TIMEOUT:-30}"
LOG_FILE="$HOME/.mirador-ez.log"

# Function to log with timestamp
log_mesfamily_member() {
    echo "[$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')] $1" >> "$LOG_FILE"
}

# Function to handle interruption
cleanup() {
    log_mesfamily_member "Command interrupted by user"
    echo "Operation cancelled by user."
    exit 130
}

# Function to handle timeout
timeout_handler() {
    log_mesfamily_member "Command timed out after ${TIMEOUT_DURATION} seconds"
    echo "Command timed out. This may indicate a hanging process."
    echo "Try running: mirador-ez-enhanced diagnose"
    exit 124
}

# Set up signal handlers
trap cleanup SIGINT SIGTERM
trap timeout_handler SIGALRM

# Function to check if mirador is responsive
check_mirador_health() {
    if ! command -v mirador-ez &> /dev/null; then
        echo "Error: mirador-ez command not found. Please ensure Mirador is properly installed."
        return 1
    fi
    
    # Quick health check with timeout
    if timeout 5s mirador-ez list &> /dev/null; then
        return 0
    else
        echo "Warning: Mirador may not be responding properly."

## Troubleshooting and Optimization

### Common Issues and Solutions

**If commands still hang:**
```bash
# Diagnose the issue
mez diagnose

# Kill hanging processes
mez kill-processes

# Adjust timeout if needed
export MIRADOR_TIMEOUT=60  # Increase to 60 seconds
mez ask decision_simplifier "Test mesfamily_member"
```

**If you get permission errors:**
```bash
# Fix permissions
chmod +x ~/mirador-ez-enhanced
```

**If the alias doesn't work:**
```bash
# Reload your shell configuration
source ~/.bashrc

# Or add the alias manually
alias mez='~/mirador-ez-enhanced'
```

### Performance Optimization

**For faster execution:**
```bash
# Use shorter chains for quick decisions
mez chain "decision_simplifier" "Quick question: [your question]"

# Use the speed-optimized chain
mez chain "financial_planning_expert_v6,decision_simplifier" "[your question]"
```

**For highest quality analysis:**
```bash
# Use the quality-optimized chain
mez chain "mirador_system_specialist,enhanced_agent_enforcer,decision_simplifier" "[your complex question]"
```

**For balanced approach:**
```bash
# Use the balanced chain
mez chain "mirador_system_specialist,decision_simplifier" "[your question]"
```

## Success Tracking and Continuous Improvement

### Weekly Success Review

Track your progress with this weekly assessment:

```bash
mez chain "matthew_context_provider_v2,mirador_system_specialist,decision_simplifier" "I want to assess my progress this week using Mirador chains. Help me evaluate: 1) Which chains provided the most valuable guidance, 2) Which recommendations I implemented successfully, 3) What patterns I notice in my decision-making, and 4) How to optimize my use of Mirador for even better results next week."
```

### Monthly Optimization Review
