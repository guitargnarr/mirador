To implement the "Strategic AI Co-Creation" framework, I recommend the following concrete next steps: Schedule a dedicated 30-minute meeting with Family_Member to discuss the concept and gather buy-in for this initiative, dedicating two hours on Wednesday and Friday mornings for the next four weeks to co-create AI-driven solutions with stakeholders across [COMPANY], leveraging existing project management tools to track progress and timeline, allocating $500/month from the current budget to support Matthew's energy-efficient workspace setup and potential travel expenses, and establishing a shared Google Drive folder for collaboration and knowledge sharing. This will enable Matthew to leverage his AI skills in creative problem-solving and strategic positioning while aligning with [COMPANY]'s business objectives, driving growth and value while fostering a culture of innovation and experimentation.
