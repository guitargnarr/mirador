**Tablature**

Here is an example of sweep picking tablature:
```
e|---------5-----7-----5-----|
B|-----7-----5-----7-----5---|
G|-----5-----7-----5-----7---|
D|-----7-----5-----7-----5---|
A|-----5-----7-----5-----7---|
E|---------3-----5-----3-----|

h=5-7-5-7 (sweeping up)
p=7-5-7-5 (sweeping down)

Repeat this pattern, focusing on smooth transitions between notes.
```
Note: This is just an example and you should adjust the tablature to fit your individual playing style and technique.
