**Financial Projections:**

* Year 1: $30,000 (touring) + $10,000 (music career development) = $40,000
* Year 2: $35,000 (touring) + $12,500 (music career development) = $47,500
* Year 3: $40,000 (touring) + $15,000 (music career development) = $55,000

**Cash Flow Management:**

To ensure a stable financial situation, Matthew should:

1. Set aside 20% of his income for taxes and savings.
2. Create an emergency fund to cover 3-6 months of living expenses.
3. Monitor his cash flow closely, adjusting his spending and income streams as needed.

By following this financial plan, Matthew can achieve his music business goals while maintaining a stable financial situation and prioritizing his values (faith, family, creativity, community impact).
