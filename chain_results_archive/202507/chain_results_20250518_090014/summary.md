Alright, so I need to create a detailed 7-day guitar practice routine focusing on sweep picking, rhythm, and theory. The user is a master guitarist specialized in technical death metal with a bunch of skills like tablature generation, theory translation, technique analysis, etc. They also mentioned that when working with feel players, we should name what they already know intuitively rather than enforcing theoretical approaches.

First, I'll break down the three main areas: sweep picking, rhythm, and theory. Each day should cover one of these areas in depth but also include elements from the other areas to ensure a balanced practice routine.

Starting with Day 1: Sweep Picking Basics. The user wants to build foundational skills, so I'll introduce basic patterns like arpeggios (A minor, E major) and scales (A minor pentatonic). Including exercises for alternate picking and string skipping makes sense since these are essential for sweep picking. Maybe include some tabs here.

Day 2: Expanding Sweep Patterns. Here, we can move beyond the basics into diminished arpeggios and more complex scales like harmonic minor. Adding tapping and hybrid picking will help with finger independence and speed. I should note techniques like hammer-ons (h) and pull-offs (p) in the tabs.

For Day 3: Rhythm Fundamentals. Focus on timing, syncopation, and different time signatures. Including exercises on ghost notes and palm muting is crucial for rhythm guitar. Maybe some examples of common rhythmic patterns in metal.

Day 4: Combining Sweep Picking with Rhythm. This day should integrate the two by working on riffs that combine sweeping with rhythmic elements. Emphasize maintaining timing while incorporating dynamics like volume control. Tabs here could show how to blend both techniques smoothly.

Moving to Day 5: Theory for Sweep Pickers. Dive into modes, intervals, and chord construction. Using examples from sweep picking exercises will help the user see the theory in action. Maybe include some scale patterns with their corresponding modes.

Day 6: Advanced Sweep Techniques. Cover economy picking, legato sweeps, and string skipping at higher speeds. This is where technical death metal elements come into play. Including tabs for these advanced patterns will be beneficial.

Finally, Day 7: Integrating Theory and Technique. Apply everything learned throughout the week by creating original riffs or analyzing existing ones. Focus on phrasing, dynamics, and songwriting to tie it all together.

I should also include additional tips like incorporating a metronome, focusing on relaxation, and building finger independence. Overall, each day builds upon the previous one, ensuring progressive development in sweep picking, rhythm, and theory.

### **7-Day Guitar Practice Routine: Sweep Picking, Rhythm, & Theory**

This routine is designed to build your technical skills while deepening your understanding of music theory and rhythm. Each day focuses on a specific area, with exercises that progressively challenge you.

---

#### **Day 1: Sweep Picking Basics**
**Objective:** Build foundational sweep picking skills and finger independence.

1. **Basic Arpeggio Patterns**
   - Start with simple arpeggios in A minor (A-C-E) and E major (E-G#-B).
   - Use alternate picking for single notes before introducing sweeps.
   - Focus on smooth transitions between strings.

   ```tab
   e|----------------|
   B|----------------|
   G|----------------|
   D|---5h7p5--------|
   A|---3h5p3--------|
   E|----------------|
   ```

2. **String Skipping**
   - Practice string skipping with a minor pentatonic scale (A minor).
   - Use economy picking to alternate between downstrokes and upstrokes.

   ```tab
   e|----------------|
   B|----------------|
   G|---7p5----------|
   D|---5p3----------|
   A|---3h5----------|
   E|----------------|
   ```

3. **Finger Independence**
   - Use a metronome to practice finger tapping on the 12th fret.
   - Alternate between fingers 1-4 and focus on even tone.

---

#### **Day 2: Expanding Sweep Patterns**
**Objective:** Introduce more complex sweep patterns and rhythmic variations.

1. **Diminished Arpeggios**
   - Practice diminished arpeggios (C# Dim) for a darker, technical sound.
   - Use hammer-ons (h) and pull-offs (p) to create legato pasfamily_members.

   ```tab
   e|----------------|
   B|----------------|
   G|---7h9p7--------|
   D|---5h7p5--------|
   A|---3h5p3--------|
   E|----------------|
   ```

2. **Scale Patterns**
   - Use the harmonic minor scale (A harmonic minor: A-B-C-D-E-F-G#) for sweeping.
   - Incorporate tapping and hybrid picking.

   ```tab
   e|----------------|
   B|---10h12p10-----|
   G|---7h9p7--------|
   D|---5h7p5--------|
   A|----------------|
   E|----------------|
   ```

3. **Rhythmic Variations**
   - Experiment with syncopated rhythms while sweeping.
   - Use a metronome to ensure timing remains consistent.

---

#### **Day 3: Rhythm Fundamentals**
**Objective:** Strengthen rhythm section skills and time feel.

1. **Ghost Notes & Palm Muting**
   - Practice ghost notes on the A string (A minor pentatonic).
   - Focus on muting with your picking hand for a clean sound.

   ```tab
   e|----------------|
   B|----------------|
   G|----------------|
   D|----------------|
   A|---5p3h5--------|
   E|----------------|
   ```

2. **Syncopation**
   - Use syncopated rhythms in 4/4 time.
   - Incorporate rests and off-beat accents.

   ```tab
   e|----------------|
   B|----------------|
   G|---7p5----------|
   D|---5p3----------|
   A|---3h5----------|
   E|----------------|
   ```

3. **Odd Time Signatures**
   - Explore 5/4 and 7/8 time signatures with simple riffs.
   - Use a metronome to internalize the feel.

---

#### **Day 4: Combining Sweep Picking & Rhythm**
**Objective:** Integrate sweep picking with rhythmic elements for technical death metal style.

1. **Sweep-Picked Riffs**
