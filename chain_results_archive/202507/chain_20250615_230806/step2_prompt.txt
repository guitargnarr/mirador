I'd be happy to help with financial planning for a Louisville family.

**Income Confirmation**
Based on your specified income of $XX,XXX, I'll use this exact amount in all calculations and recommendations moving forward.

**Budget Framework**
To create a budget framework for a Louisville family with an annual income of $XX,XXX, we'll consider the 50/30/20 rule:

* 50% of income for necessary expenses (housing, utilities, food, transportation, and minimum debt payments)
* 30% for discretionary spending (entertainment, hobbies, travel)
* 20% for saving and debt repayment

Assuming a family of four with two adults and two children, here's a breakdown of the budget:

* Necessary expenses: $37,500 (50% of $XX,XXX)
	+ Housing: $15,000 (40% of necessary expenses)
	+ Utilities: $1,500
	+ Food: $3,500
	+ Transportation: $2,500
	+ Minimum debt payments: $2,000
* Discretionary spending: $22,500 (30% of $XX,XXX)
* Savings and debt repayment: $15,000 (20% of $XX,XXX)

**Louisville-Specific Considerations**
As a Louisville family, you should be aware of the following local factors:

* Kentucky state income tax: 5% flat rate (2024)
* Jefferson County property tax rates: approximately 0.91% average
* Louisville median home price: $200,000-$250,000 (2024)

**Implementation Steps with Local Resources**
To implement this budget framework, consider the following steps:

1. Review and adjust your housing expenses to ensure you're not overpaying for rent or mortgage.
2. Take advantage of local resources like the Louisville Metro Government's website for information on utility bills and transportation options.
3. Explore tax-advantaged savings options, such as a 401(k) or IRA, through your employer or a financial institution.
