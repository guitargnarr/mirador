Family_Member needs stability but also needs to see healthy relationship modeling. I'm building something with Family_Member but can't let it destabilize his foundation. My childhood taught me what 
  insecurity feels like - how do I ensure he never experiences that while still growing our family dynamic? What does this look like day-to-day?
