3. **Innovation Consulting with a Social Twist**: By incorporating his servant leadership style, Matthew could offer consulting services to businesses seeking innovative solutions with a positive impact on the community.

**Specific Model Sequence Suggestion:**

To achieve this hybrid approach, I recommend the following model sequence:

1. **Decision Simplifier**: Use the decision simplifier to identify potential social impact projects that align with Matthew's values and strengths.

3. **Financial Planning Expert**: Collaborate with the financial planning expert to ensure that Matthew's project is financially sustainable and aligned with his family's needs.

* Generates revenue through content creation and consulting services
* Supports his family's well-being while making a positive impact on the community

**Alternative Strategies:**

If Matthew finds that his initial approach doesn't yield the desired results, he could consider alternative strategies, such as:
