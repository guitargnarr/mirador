**Louisville-Specific Cost of Living Considerations:**

To ensure Matthew's budget is realistic and takes into account the local cost of living, I've considered the following expenses:

* Average 1BR rent in Louisville: $1,000-1,300 (Matthew's housing expense is within this range)

* Transportation costs (car payment, insurance, gas): $5,000
* Food expenses (groceries, dining out): $3,500

**Actionable Recommendations:**

To further optimize Matthew's budget and achieve his financial goals, I recommend the following:

1. **Emergency Fund:** Continue to save 10% of income ($7,500) for the next 12-18 months.
2. **Retirement Savings:** Contribute at least 5% of income ($3,750) towards retirement savings.
3. **Debt Repayment:** Focus on paying off high-interest loans or credit cards as quickly as possible, aiming to eliminate them within the next 12-18 months.
4. **Business and Music Expenses:** Review Matthew's business expenses and adjust as needed to ensure he's staying within his allocated budget of $11,250.
5. **Touring Income:** Aim to earn at least $20,000 per tour, with a goal of 4-6 tours per year.
6. **Music Sales and Licensing:** Target $5,000 in music sales and licensing income per year.
7. **Merchandise and Sponsorships:** Estimate $2,000 in merchandise sales and sponsorship revenue per year.

Louisville offers a range of financial resources and opportunities for Matthew to explore:
