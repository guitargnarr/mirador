**Comprehensive Financial Plan for Matthew**

Based on the provided analysis, I'll create a comprehensive financial plan tailored to Matthew's needs, taking into account his income, debt, investments in personal growth, and family financial security.

**Income and Expenses**

Matthew's target income is $XX,XXX per year. Assuming a 25% tax bracket (state and federal), his take-home pay would be approximately:

$XX,XXX x 0.75 = $56,250 per year
$56,250 / 12 months = $4,688 per month

Here's a breakdown of Matthew's monthly expenses based on the 50/30/20 rule:

1. Necessary Expenses (50%): $2,344 per month
	* Housing: $1,200 (assuming a median home price of $250,000)
	* Food: $600
	* Utilities: $300
	* Transportation: $200
	* Insurance: $100
	* Minimum debt payments: $444
2. Discretionary Spending (30%): $1,412 per month
	* Entertainment: $800
	* Hobbies: $400
	* Travel: $200
3. Savings and Debt Repayment (20%): $934 per month
	* Emergency fund: $500
	* Debt repayment: $434

**Debt Analysis and Repayment**

Matthew's debt analysis is not specified, but based on his income and expenses, let's assume he has:

1. Credit card debt with an average interest rate of 18%
2. A personal loan with an interest rate of 6%

To prioritize high-interest debts, Matthew should focus on paying off the credit card debt first.

**Recommendations**

1. **Debt Snowball Method**: Pay off the credit card debt with the smallest balance first, while making minimum payments on the personal loan.
2. **Bi-Weekly Payments**: Set up bi-weekly payments to make 26 payments per year, rather than 12. This will result in an extra payment of $200 per month towards his debts.
3. **Consolidation**: Consider consolidating similar debts into a single loan with a lower interest rate and a longer repayment period.

**Investments in Personal Growth**

Matthew should allocate:

1. **Online Courses**: $500-$1000 per year for online courses or workshops that enhance his skills as a creative technologist and musician.
2. **Conferences and Events**: 1-2 conferences or events related to his industry each year, where he can network and learn from others.

**Family Financial Security**

To ensure family financial security:

1. **Budgeting**: Create a budget that allocates 50% of his income towards necessary expenses (housing, food, utilities), 30% towards discretionary spending, and 20% towards savings and debt repayment.
2. **Emergency Fund**: Continue to prioritize building an easily accessible savings account for family emergencies.

**Action Plan**

1. Gather all debt information and create a list with balances, interest rates, and minimum payments.
2. Prioritize high-interest debts and focus on paying those off first using the debt snowball method.
3. Set up bi-weekly payments and consider consolidating similar debts.
4. Allocate $500-$1000 per year for online courses or workshops that enhance Matthew's skills.
5. Review and adjust the budget every 6-12 months to ensure it remains aligned with his goals and priorities.

**Local Financial Resources and Opportunities**

Louisville, Kentucky offers various financial resources and opportunities:

1. **Financial Counseling**: The Louisville Community Foundation provides free financial counseling services.
2. **Small Business Development Centers (SBDCs)**: The University of Louisville's SBDC can provide guidance on starting or growing a small business.
3. **Investment Opportunities**: Consider investing in local startups or real estate investment trusts (REITs) to diversify your portfolio.

By following this comprehensive financial plan, Matthew can effectively manage his debt, invest in personal growth, and ensure family financial security while taking advantage of local resources and opportunities.
