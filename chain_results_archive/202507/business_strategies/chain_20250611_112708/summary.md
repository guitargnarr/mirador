I'd be happy to help you with a Louisville market test.

**Current Financial Assessment**

To get started, I'll need some information from you. Please provide the following:

1. Your current income (after taxes)
2. Your fixed expenses (e.g., rent/mortgage, utilities, car payment, insurance, minimum credit card payments)
3. Your debt (including credit cards, student loans, personal loans)
4. Your savings goals (e.g., emergency fund, retirement, specific purchases)

Assuming you're a single individual or couple in Louisville, here's a rough estimate of your expenses:

* Housing: 30% of income
* Transportation: 10-15%

**Specific Recommendations with Numbers**

Based on your input, here are some specific recommendations:

1. **Budget optimization**: Allocate 50% of your income towards fixed expenses, 30% towards discretionary spending, and 20% towards savings and debt repayment.
