**Budget Framework:**
To generate strong cash flow, we'll look at investment opportunities with lower purchase prices (less than $500,000) and higher rental yields (around 8-10%). Here's a rough estimate of the budget framework:

* Down payment: 20-30% of the purchase price
* Monthly mortgage payment: approximately $1,500-$2,000
* Rental income: $1,200-$1,500 per month
* Expenses (property management, insurance, maintenance): $300-$400 per month

**Louisville-Specific Considerations:**

1. **Office Space:** The Louisville office market has seen a decline in recent years, but there are still opportunities for investors to buy and rent out smaller spaces.
2. **Retail Properties:** With the growth of the local economy, retail properties with strong foot traffic (e.g., near University of Louisville or downtown areas) can generate stable cash flows.
3. **Multi-Family Apartments:** The Louisville apartment market is relatively affordable, making it an attractive option for investors looking to diversify their portfolios.

**Implementation Steps with Local Resources:**

1. **Office Space:** Consider purchasing a small office building (less than 10,000 sqft) in the downtown or NuLu areas.
2. **Retail Properties:** Look for retail spaces with strong foot traffic and reasonable lease terms.
3. **Multi-Family Apartments:** Explore opportunities to buy an existing apartment complex or consider new construction projects.

**Professional Consultation Recommendations:**

1. **Work with a local commercial real estate agent** who has experience in the Louisville market.
2. **Consult with a financial advisor** to ensure you have sufficient funds for down payments and ongoing expenses.
3. **Research local zoning laws and regulations** to understand any potential restrictions or requirements.

Some specific investment opportunities to consider:

* A 2,000 sqft office building in downtown Louisville for $350,000 ( purchase price: $70,000 down payment)
* A retail space with a monthly rent of $1,200 in the NuLu area
* A 20-unit apartment complex in the Highlands neighborhood
