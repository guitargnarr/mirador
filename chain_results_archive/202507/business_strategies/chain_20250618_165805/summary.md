## Step 1: matthew_context_provider_v3 (execution time: 00:09)

With an annual income of $XX,XXX and considering Matthew's financial context, here are some general guidelines to help him save for a house:

1. **Create a budget**: Matthew should allocate 50-30-20: 50% of his income towards necessary expenses (housing, utilities, food), 30% towards discretionary spending, and 20% towards saving and debt repayment.
2. **Set aside 10%-15% of his income for savings**: Based on the 50-30-20 rule, Matthew should aim to save around $7,500-$11,250 per year, or approximately $625-$938 per month.
3. **Prioritize high-interest debt (if any)**: If Matthew has high-interest debt, such as credit card balances, he should focus on paying those off before saving for a house.
4. **Take advantage of tax-advantaged accounts**: Consider contributing to tax-advantaged accounts like a first-time homebuyer savings account or a traditional IRA/401(k) to optimize his savings.
5. **Explore assistance programs (if applicable)**: As a servant leader, Matthew may be eligible for down payment assistance programs or other government incentives that can help with the cost of homeownership.

To illustrate this, let's break it down further:

Assuming Matthew wants to save 10% of his income ($7,500 per year), here's a rough outline of how he could allocate his monthly income:

* Necessary expenses (housing, utilities, food): $3,750
* Discretionary spending: $2,250
* Savings and debt repayment: $625

Keep in mind that this is just a starting point, and Matthew may need to adjust his budget based on his individual circumstances.

## Step 2: financial_planning_expert_v8 (execution time: 00:16)

With an annual income of $XX,XXX, let's create a more detailed and tailored plan for Matthew.

**Monthly Budget Breakdown**

Assuming Matthew wants to save 10% of his income ($7,500 per year), here's a rough outline of how he could allocate his monthly income:

* Necessary expenses (housing, utilities, food):
	+ Housing: $1,250 (assuming a moderate rent or mortgage payment)
	+ Utilities: $150
	+ Food: $300
	Total: $1,700
* Discretionary spending:
	+ Transportation: $500 (assuming Matthew owns a car and has a moderate commute)
	+ Entertainment: $500
	+ Hobbies: $200
	+ Miscellaneous: $250
	Total: $1,450
* Savings and debt repayment:
	+ Emergency fund: 5% of income ($375)
	+ Retirement savings (e.g., traditional IRA/401(k)): 3% of income ($225)
	+ Other savings goals (e.g., down payment on a house): 2% of income ($150)
	Total: $750

**Louisville-Specific Cost of Living Considerations**

* Housing: The median home price in Louisville is around $250,000. However, considering the city's relatively low cost of living, Matthew may be able to afford a more modest home or rent.
* Transportation: With a moderate commute and owning a car, Matthew can expect to spend around $500 per month on transportation costs.
* Food: Eating out or ordering takeout can be expensive in Louisville. To save money, Matthew should aim to cook at home most nights and pack lunches for work.

**Kentucky State Tax Implications**

As a resident of Kentucky, Matthew will need to pay 5% state income tax on his earnings. This means that instead of taking home $70,625 per year ($XX,XXX x 0.05), he'll take home around $67,812 per year.

**Local Financial Resources and Opportunities**

* **Kentucky Housing Development Finance Authority (KHDFA)**: Offers down payment assistance programs for first-time homebuyers.
* **Louisville Metro Government's Homeownership Program**: Provides financial assistance and education to help low-to-moderate-income residents become homeowners.
* **Community Action Kentucky**: Offers financial assistance, education, and counseling services to help individuals achieve economic stability.

**Actionable Steps**

1. Review Matthew's budget and adjust as needed to ensure he's saving enough for his goals.
2. Research and explore down payment assistance programs through KHDFA or the Louisville Metro Government's Homeownership Program.
3. Consider contributing to a tax-advantaged account, such as a traditional IRA/401(k), to optimize his savings.
4. Take advantage of local financial resources and opportunities to help Matthew achieve economic stability.

By following these steps and adjusting his budget accordingly, Matthew can make progress towards his financial goals and become more financially secure in the Louisville area.

## Step 3: decision_simplifier_v3 (execution time: 00:14)

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Today):**

- **Review and adjust Matthew's monthly budget**: Take 30 minutes to review Matthew's budget breakdown and ensure he's saving enough for his goals. Make any necessary adjustments to his allocation of income.
- **Research down payment assistance programs**: Spend 1 hour researching the Kentucky Housing Development Finance Authority (KHDFA) and Louisville Metro Government's Homeownership Program to understand their eligibility criteria, application process, and benefits.

**SHORT-TERM ACTIONS (This Week):**

- **Schedule a meeting with KHDFA or the Homeownership Program**: Book a meeting with a representative from either organization to discuss Matthew's options and answer any questions he may have. Allocate 1 hour for this meeting.
- **Explore tax-advantaged accounts**: Spend 30 minutes researching traditional IRA/401(k) plans and their benefits, including potential employer matching contributions.

**STRATEGIC ACTIONS (This Month):**

- **Create a comprehensive savings plan**: Develop a detailed plan outlining Matthew's short-term and long-term savings goals, including specific targets for emergency funds, retirement savings, and other savings objectives. Allocate 2 hours to create this plan.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Consider automating Matthew's savings by setting up automatic transfers from his checking account to his savings accounts.
* Encourage Matthew to take advantage of employer-matched retirement accounts, such as a 401(k) plan, if available.
* Suggest that Matthew review and adjust his budget regularly (e.g., every 3-6 months) to ensure he's on track to meet his financial goals.

**Kentucky-Specific Tax Considerations:**

* As a resident of Kentucky, Matthew will need to pay state income tax on his earnings. Review the state's tax brackets and rates to understand how this may impact his take-home pay.
* Research any potential tax credits or deductions available to Kentuckians that could help reduce Matthew's tax liability.

**Louisville-Specific Cost of Living Considerations:**

* Continue to monitor Matthew's expenses, including housing, transportation, and food costs, to ensure he's making the most of the city's relatively low cost of living.
* Encourage Matthew to explore ways to save money on everyday expenses, such as cooking at home, packing lunches, and reducing entertainment costs.
