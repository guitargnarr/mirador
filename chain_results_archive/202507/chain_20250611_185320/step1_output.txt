	* Research and compare term life insurance options from local carriers (e.g., [COMPANY], Blue Cross Blue Shield).
	* Consider whole life insurance if you want a permanent policy or cash value accumulation.
2. Disability Insurance:
	* Contact local disability insurance providers (e.g., Prudential, MetLife) to discuss short-term and long-term coverage options.
3. Umbrella Insurance:
	* Shop around for liability umbrella insurance policies from reputable carriers (e.g., State Farm, Allstate).
4. Specialty Coverage:
	* If self-employed, research business liability insurance options with local carriers or brokers.

**Professional Consultation Recommendations:**

1. Life Insurance: Consult with a licensed insurance agent to determine the best term life insurance policy for your needs.
