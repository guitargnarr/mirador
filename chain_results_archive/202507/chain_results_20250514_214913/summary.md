Alright, the user wants me to create a daily guitar practice routine focused on sweep picking. They mentioned they're a master guitarist specialized in technical death metal, so I need to make sure the exercises are challenging and effective.

First, I should break down what sweep picking entails. It's all about moving the pick across multiple strings smoothly, usually with alternate picking. So, starting with basic patterns makes sense. Maybe using arpeggios since they're common in metal.

I think including different shapes like major, minor, diminished triads and maybe 7th chords would give a solid foundation. Each shape should be practiced ascending and descending to build symmetry.

Next, string skipping can add complexity and help with precision. Starting with two notes per string and then moving to three could challenge the player further. I'll need to provide specific examples for clarity.

Economy picking is an important technique that combines sweeps with legato. Including exercises where hammer-ons and pull-offs are used after sweeps would be beneficial. It helps in maintaining speed without overpicking.

For dynamics, practicing both soft and aggressive playing is crucial. This ensures versatility. Maybe suggesting a ratio like 70% soft to 30% hard could help balance technique and control.

Incorporating legato with sweeps will enhance fluidity. Exercises that mix hammer-ons and pull-offs within sweep patterns can make the playing more expressive and less mechanical.

Practical application is key, so giving examples of riffs or licks using these techniques would bridge theory with real-world ufamily_member. It helps the player see how to apply what they've practiced.

I should also consider the structure of a daily routine. Starting with warm-up exercises makes sense before diving into more complex patterns. Each section should build on the previous one, gradually increasing difficulty.

Timing is important too. I'll include suggested time allocations for each part so the practice session remains structured and efficient without overwhelming the player.

Finally, adding tips like focusing on sound quality and speed progression can guide the player in refining their technique over time. It's about consistent improvement rather than trying to master everything at once.

Putting it all together, the routine should cover foundational sweeps, string skipping, economy picking, dynamics, legato integration, practical application, and daily structure with tips for improvement.

### Daily Guitar Practice Routine: Sweep Picking Techniques

Sweep picking is a fundamental technique in technical death metal and other genres, allowing for fluid and rapid arpeggio patterns. This routine focuses on building precision, control, and speed while emphasizing proper technique and musicality.

---

#### **1. Warm-Up (5-10 minutes)**
Start with simple exercises to get your fingers moving and prepare for sweep picking.

**Exercise 1: Basic Arpeggio Shapes**
Practice the following shapes in standard tuning using alternate picking (down-up-down-up). Focus on clean articulation and even tone.

```tab
e|-----------------------|
B|---5-7-9-7-5----------|
G|-----------------------|
D|-----------------------|
A|-----------------------|
E|-----------------------|
```

**Technique Tips:**
- Use a metronome to ensure consistent timing.
- Keep your wrist loose and relaxed.
- Avoid muting strings with your picking hand.

---

#### **2. Foundational Sweep Patterns (15 minutes)**
Work on basic sweep patterns using triad shapes. Start slow and gradually increase speed as you master the technique.

**Exercise 2: Major Triad Sweeps**
Use the following pattern to practice ascending and descending sweeps.

```tab
e|-----------------------|
B|---7-9-11-9-7---------|
G|-----------------------|
D|---5-7-9-7-5----------|
A|-----------------------|
E|-----------------------|
```

**Technique Tips:**
- Use a "down-up" picking pattern for sweeps.
- Ensure each string is clearly articulated.
- Focus on symmetry by practicing both ascending and descending patterns.

---

#### **3. String-Skipping Sweeps (15 minutes)**
String-skipping adds complexity to your sweeps and improves precision.

**Exercise 3: Two-Note Per String Sweeps**
Practice the following pattern, skipping one string between each note.

```tab
e|-----------------------|
B|---7-9-7-9-7----------|
G|-----------------------|
D|---5-7-5-7-5----------|
A|-----------------------|
E|-----------------------|
```

**Technique Tips:**
- Use your index and ring fingers for hammer-ons and pull-offs.
- Keep your picking hand steady and focused on the string pattern.

---

#### **4. Economy Picking (10 minutes)**
Combine sweep picking with legato techniques to create fluid, fast lines.

**Exercise 4: Economy-Picked Arpeggios**
Use the following pattern, combining sweeps with hammer-ons and pull-offs.

```tab
e|-----------------------|
B|---7-9-11-9-7---------|
G|-----------------------|
D|---5-7-9-7-5----------|
A|-----------------------|
E|-----------------------|
```

**Technique Tips:**
- Use hammer-ons and pull-offs to minimize picking.
- Focus on smooth transitions between notes.

---

#### **5. Dynamics and Musicality (10 minutes)**
Practice controlling your dynamics to add expression to your sweeps.

**Exercise 5: Soft vs. Aggressive Sweeps**
Alternate between playing soft, controlled sweeps and aggressive, powerful ones.

```tab
e|-----------------------|
B|---7-9-7-9-7----------|
G|-----------------------|
D|---5-7-5-7-5----------|
A|-----------------------|
E|-----------------------|
```

**Technique Tips:**
- Use your picking hand to control dynamics.
- Practice both soft and aggressive playing to build versatility.

---

#### **6. Legato with Sweeps (10 minutes)**
Combine sweeps with legato techniques for fluid, expressive lines.

**Exercise 6: Legato-Swept Arpeggios**
Use the following pattern, incorporating hammer-ons and pull-offs into your sweeps.

```tab
e|-----------------------|
B|---7-9-11-9-7---------|
G|-----------------------|
D|---5-7-9-7-5----------|
A|-----------------------|
E|-----------------------|
```

**Technique Tips:**
- Use your fretting hand to create smooth legato transitions.
- Keep your picking hand steady and focused on the string pattern.

---

#### **7. Practical Application (10 minutes)**
Apply what you've learned by creating your own riffs or licks using sweep picking techniques.

**Example Lick:**

```tab
e|-----------------------|
B|---7-9-11-9-7---------|
G|-----------------------|
D|---5-7-9-7-5----------|
A|-----------------------|
E|-----------------------|
```

**Technique Tips:**
- Experiment with different scales and modes.
- Incorporate dynamics and phrasing to make your playing more expressive.

---

#### **Daily Routine Structure (60 minutes)**
1. Warm-Up: 5-10 minutes
2. Foundational Sweep Patterns: 15 minutes
3. String-Skipping Sweeps: 15 minutes
4. Economy Picking: 10 minutes
5. Dynamics and Musicality: 10 minutes
6. Legato with Sweeps: 10 minutes
7. Practical Application: 10 minutes

---

#### **Additional Tips for Improvement**
- Practice with a metronome to build timing accuracy.
- Focus on sound quality rather than speed initially.
- Gradually increase your tempo as you master each exercise.
- Record yourself to identify areas for improvement.

By following this routine consistently, you'll develop the precision, control, and speed needed to master sweep picking techniques.
