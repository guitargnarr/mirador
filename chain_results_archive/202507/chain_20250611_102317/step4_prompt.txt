**Assumptions:**

* The current home value of $140,000 is accurate.

* The pay schedule of every 2 weeks for both Matthew and his girlfriend is consistent.

**Financial Analysis:**

1. **Current Situation:** With a remaining mortgage of $REDACTED and an equity value of $91,000, the couple has a significant amount of wealth tied up in their current home. This could be leveraged to invest in tax-advantaged accounts or other assets.
2. **Tax Implications:**
	* Kentucky's 5% flat state income tax rate applies to the combined household income of $REDACTED, resulting in approximately $7,250 in annual taxes.

		+ 401(k) or IRA contributions
		+ Health Savings Account (HSA) funding for medical expenses
		+ Municipal bonds or other tax-exempt investments
3. **Investment Opportunities:**
	* With a stable income and significant equity in their current home, Matthew and his girlfriend may consider investing in:
		+ Tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA, HSA)
		+ High-yield savings accounts or certificates of deposit (CDs)
		+ Stocks, bonds, or other investment vehicles
4. **Family Considerations:**
	* The couple's daughter is starting 2nd grade, and her changing school schedule may impact their living situation.
	* Matthew's goal of becoming a LinkedIn thought leader by the end of 2025 requires careful planning to ensure flexibility in their living arrangements.

**Personal Preferences:**

1. **Emotional Attachment:** Matthew's girlfriend is emotionally attached to their current apartment, which may make it difficult for her to leave.
2. **Flexibility:** Considering a temporary move to Matthew's house while house hunting could be a viable option, allowing them to maintain flexibility and avoid the stress of moving twice.

**Long-term Goals:**

1. **Thought Leadership:** Matthew's goal of becoming a LinkedIn thought leader by the end of 2025 is ambitious but achievable with careful planning.
2. **Family Considerations:** The couple's daughter is starting 2nd grade, and her changing school schedule may impact their living situation.

**Decision Framework:**

Based on the refined analysis, here are some key considerations for Matthew and his girlfriend:

1. **Weigh the pros and cons of staying in the current apartment vs. moving to a new home:** Consider factors such as cost, flexibility, emotional attachment, and tax implications.
2. **Assess the feasibility of owning a new home:** Evaluate the potential monthly rent range, new home budget, investment opportunities, and long-term goals.
3. **Explore temporary housing options:** Temporary moves to Matthew's house while house hunting could be a viable solution, allowing them to maintain flexibility and avoid the stress of moving twice.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the comprehensive analysis, I recommend that Matthew and his girlfriend consider the following:

1. **Temporary move to Matthew's house:** Allow them to maintain flexibility and avoid the stress of moving twice while they explore new home options.
2. **New home budget allocation:** Allocate a significant portion of their combined income towards a new home, considering factors such as mortgage payments, property taxes, investment opportunities, and long-term goals.
3. **Tax-advantaged investing:** Consider contributing to tax-advantaged accounts such as 401(k) or IRA to maximize retirement savings opportunities.
4. **Long-term planning:** Regularly review and adjust their budget to ensure they are on track to meet their long-term goals, including Matthew's thought leadership aspirations.
