## Important Notes
- This backup contains YOUR personal financial data
- It includes Excel files with financial calculations
- Keep it secure if you need the financial data
- Delete it if you have copies elsewhere

## Verification Commands
To verify the cleanup worked:
```bash
# Check no sensitive files in current repo
find . -name "*.xlsx" -o -name "*financial*" -o -name "*[company]*" | wc -l
# Should return 0

# Check Git history
git log --all --full-history -- "*.xlsx" | wc -l
# Should return 0
```

Remember: The sensitive data is now ONLY in your backup. The repository is clean.
