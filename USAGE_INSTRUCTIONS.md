Getting Started
First Time Setup
After installation, run these commands to verify your system:
bash# Check system status
./daily_check_enhanced.sh

# Test basic functionality
mirador-ez ask matthew_context_provider_v3 "Tell me about my personality"

# Run your first smart chain
./mirador-smart-v2 "What are my top opportunities today?"
Understanding Output
Mirador saves all outputs in timestamped directories:
outputs/
├── chain_20250618_090633/
│   ├── step_1_output.md      # First model's response
│   ├── step_2_output.md      # Second model's response
│   ├── step_3_output.md      # Third model's response
│   └── summary.md            # Complete chain summary
Basic Commands
Direct Model Queries
Use mirador-ez ask for single model queries:
bash# Ask a specific model
mirador-ez ask [model_name] "[your question]"

# Examples
mirador-ez ask financial_planning_expert_v8 "How should I invest $5000?"
mirador-ez ask louisville_expert_v3 "Best coffee shops near Bardstown Road"
mirador-ez ask enhanced_agent_enforcer "Strategic analysis of remote work"
Manual Chain Execution
Use mirador-ez chain for multi-model analysis:
bash# Basic syntax
mirador-ez chain "[description]" model1 model2 model3

# Example
mirador-ez chain "Career planning analysis" \
    matthew_context_provider_v3 \
    enhanced_agent_enforcer \
    decision_simplifier_v3
Smart Chains
Using mirador-smart-v2
The intelligent wrapper automatically selects the best chain:
bash# Financial queries
./mirador-smart-v2 "How can I save for a house with 75000 income?"
# → Uses: matthew_context → financial_expert → decision_simplifier

# Music career queries
./mirador-smart-v2 "Steps to become touring guitarist this year"
# → Uses: matthew_context → music_networker → guitar_instructor → decision_simplifier

# Local opportunity queries
./mirador-smart-v2 "Louisville networking events for musicians"
# → Uses: matthew_context → louisville_expert → decision_simplifier

# General strategic queries
./mirador-smart-v2 "Identify my best opportunities this month"
# → Uses: matthew_context → enhanced_agent → decision_simplifier
Chain Selection Logic
Query Contains          →  Selected Chain
─────────────────────────────────────────
financial/money/budget  →  Financial Optimization Chain
music/guitar/touring    →  Music Career Chain  
Louisville/local/KY     →  Local Resources Chain
opportunity/strategy    →  Strategic Analysis Chain
personality/traits      →  Self-Awareness Chain
(default)              →  General Analysis Chain

    master_guitar_instructor \
    music_career_timeline_strategist \
    decision_simplifier_v3

    music_industry_networker \
    louisville_expert_v3 \

Memory-Enhanced Queries
Use the memory wrapper for context-aware responses:
bash# Uses SQLite database to track patterns
./mirador_with_memory.sh ask enhanced_agent_enforcer "Follow up on last week's opportunities"

# Memory system tracks:
# - Previous queries and responses
# - Success patterns
# - Implementation results
Parallel Analysis
For faster results on independent analyses:
bash# Run multiple queries simultaneously
{
    ./mirador-smart-v2 "Financial opportunities" > financial.md &
    ./mirador-smart-v2 "Music career steps" > music.md &
    ./mirador-smart-v2 "Local resources" > local.md &
    wait
}
# Combine results
cat financial.md music.md local.md > combined_analysis.md
Creating Custom Models
Add specialized expertise:
bash# Create modelfile
cat > my_custom_expert.modelfile << 'EOF'
