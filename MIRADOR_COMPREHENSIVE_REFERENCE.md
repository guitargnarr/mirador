## Development Guidelines

### Code Style (Following User Preferences)
1. **Comprehensive Documentation** - Every component thoroughly documented
2. **Standardized Approaches** - Consistent patterns across all scripts
3. **Version Control** - Proper git tagging for major updates
4. **File Path References** - Always specify exact locations
5. **Practical Delivery** - Focus on real-world utility

### Naming Conventions
- **Scripts**: `snake_case.sh`
- **Models**: `descriptive_name_v4_accurate`
- **Functions**: `clear_descriptive_names()`
- **Variables**: `UPPER_CASE` for constants, `lower_case` for locals

### Error Handling
```bash
# Standard error handling pattern
if [ $? -eq 0 ] && [ -n "$OUTPUT" ]; then
    echo "✓ Success"
else
    echo "✗ Failed"
    exit 1
fi
```

### Testing Requirements
- All new features must include practical utility tests
- Tests should validate real-world applicability
- Performance benchmarks for chain execution times
- Success rate tracking over time

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Model Not Found
```bash
Error: model not found
```
**Solution**: Run model creation script
```bash
./create_optimized_models_fixed.sh
```

#### 2. Chain Execution Timeout
```bash
Chain failed after timeout
```
**Solution**: Models may be initializing. Wait and retry, or check Ollama status:
```bash
ollama list
ps aux | grep ollama
```

#### 3. Empty Response
```bash
✗ Error running model
```
**Solution**: Check model parameters and Ollama availability:
```bash
ollama run matthew_context_provider_v4_accurate "test"
```

### Performance Optimization
- **Apple Silicon**: Ensure `num_thread: 8` for optimal performance
- **Memory**: Models use ~6.4GB each, ensure sufficient RAM
- **Context**: Larger context windows (8192) may slow initial responses

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Enable verbose output
MIRADOR_DEBUG=1 ./mirador_universal_runner.sh life_optimization "test prompt"

# Check individual model responses
echo "test" | ollama run model_name
```
