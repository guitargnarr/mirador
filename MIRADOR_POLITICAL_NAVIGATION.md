## 📧 STRATEGIC COMMUNICATION TEMPLATES

### Email to Skeptical Stakeholder
```
Subject: Addressing Your Concerns About Mirador

Hi [Name],

I appreciate your thoughtful questions about Mirador yesterday. 
Your concerns about [specific issue] are exactly why I built 
in [specific safeguard].

Would you be open to a 15-minute technical review where I can 
show you the security/compliance/audit features in detail?

I value your expertise and would welcome your input on making 
Mirador even more robust.

Best,
Matthew

### Building Alliance Email
```
Subject: Your Innovation + Mirador = Breakthrough?

Hi [Name],

I've been following your work on [their project] - impressive 
results! I think there might be synergy with something I've 
been building.

Mirador is an AI orchestration framework that's saved my team 
30 hours/week. I'm wondering if it could amplify what you're 
doing in [their area].

Coffee next week to explore?

Matthew

## ⚡ REMEMBER

**Politics is about people, not positions.**

- Make them heroes, not obstacles
- Solve their problems, not yours
- Share credit liberally
- Build bridges, not walls

**Your secret weapon isn't Mirador - it's making everyone else successful with Mirador.**

---

## 🎯 THE MASTER MOVE

When all else fails, remember:

**"I built this because I believe in [COMPANY]'s mission and our associates' potential. If there's a better way to achieve 97% efficiency while empowering our people, I'm all ears. Until then, let me show you what's possible."**

Then do the demo. Results overcome politics.

*"In politics, as in technology, the best solution is the one that makes everyone look good."*

**Navigate wisely. Build coalitions. Transform [COMPANY].** 🚀
