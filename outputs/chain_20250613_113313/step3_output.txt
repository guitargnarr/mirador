To optimize your financial planning, we'll focus on the 50/30/20 rule: Allocate 50% of your income towards necessary expenses, 30% towards discretionary spending, and 20% towards saving and debt repayment. This will provide a solid foundation for achieving your financial goals.

3. Personal expenses: $1,000 - $2,000 (clothing, accessories, gifts)
