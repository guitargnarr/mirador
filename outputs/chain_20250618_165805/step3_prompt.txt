With an annual income of $XX,XXX, let's create a more detailed and tailored plan for Matthew.

**Monthly Budget Breakdown**

Assuming Matthew wants to save 10% of his income ($7,500 per year), here's a rough outline of how he could allocate his monthly income:

* Necessary expenses (housing, utilities, food):
	+ Housing: $1,250 (assuming a moderate rent or mortgage payment)
	+ Utilities: $150
	+ Food: $300
	Total: $1,700
* Discretionary spending:
	+ Transportation: $500 (assuming Matthew owns a car and has a moderate commute)
	+ Entertainment: $500
	+ Hobbies: $200
	+ Miscellaneous: $250
	Total: $1,450
* Savings and debt repayment:
	+ Emergency fund: 5% of income ($375)
	+ Retirement savings (e.g., traditional IRA/401(k)): 3% of income ($225)
	+ Other savings goals (e.g., down payment on a house): 2% of income ($150)
	Total: $750

**Louisville-Specific Cost of Living Considerations**

* Housing: The median home price in Louisville is around $250,000. However, considering the city's relatively low cost of living, Matthew may be able to afford a more modest home or rent.
* Transportation: With a moderate commute and owning a car, Matthew can expect to spend around $500 per month on transportation costs.
* Food: Eating out or ordering takeout can be expensive in Louisville. To save money, Matthew should aim to cook at home most nights and pack lunches for work.

**Kentucky State Tax Implications**

As a resident of Kentucky, Matthew will need to pay 5% state income tax on his earnings. This means that instead of taking home $70,625 per year ($XX,XXX x 0.05), he'll take home around $67,812 per year.

**Local Financial Resources and Opportunities**

* **Kentucky Housing Development Finance Authority (KHDFA)**: Offers down payment assistance programs for first-time homebuyers.
* **Louisville Metro Government's Homeownership Program**: Provides financial assistance and education to help low-to-moderate-income residents become homeowners.
* **Community Action Kentucky**: Offers financial assistance, education, and counseling services to help individuals achieve economic stability.

**Actionable Steps**

1. Review Matthew's budget and adjust as needed to ensure he's saving enough for his goals.
2. Research and explore down payment assistance programs through KHDFA or the Louisville Metro Government's Homeownership Program.
3. Consider contributing to a tax-advantaged account, such as a traditional IRA/401(k), to optimize his savings.
4. Take advantage of local financial resources and opportunities to help Matthew achieve economic stability.

By following these steps and adjusting his budget accordingly, Matthew can make progress towards his financial goals and become more financially secure in the Louisville area.
