# Quick Actions

**Immediate Actions:**
* **Block dedicated music time**: Schedule 2 hours, 3 times a week, in your calendar for focused music practice and rehearsals. (e.g., Monday, Wednesday, Friday, 7:00-9:00 PM)
* **Communicate with Family_Member**: Reach out to Family_Member and discuss your schedule, commitments, and needs to ensure you're both on the same page. (e.g., tonight, 30 minutes before dinner)
* **Set realistic work expectations**: Review your work tasks for the next week and prioritize 3 essential tasks. Eliminate or delegate non-essential tasks to free up time for music and self-care. (e.g., today, 30 minutes after waking up)
* **Create a self-care buffer**: Allocate 1 hour each day for personal activities (e.g., exercise, meditation, hobbies) to maintain energy and creativity. (e.g., schedule it in your calendar)
* **Update budget and financial planning**: Reassess your financial situation and adjust your budget to accommodate music-related expenses (e.g., instrument maintenance, lessons). (e.g., tonight, 30 minutes before dinner)
