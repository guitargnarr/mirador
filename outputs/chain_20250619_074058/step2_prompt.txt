5. **Cash Reserve**: Maintain a cash reserve of 10% to 15% for unexpected expenses, emergency funds, and opportunities that may arise during the investment journey.

Risk Management Strategies:

* **Dollar-Cost Averaging**: Invest a fixed amount regularly to reduce the impact of market volatility on individual investments.
* **Regular Portfolio Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust the portfolio to maintain the target asset allocation and ensure it remains aligned with Matthew's risk tolerance and goals.
* **Long-Term Focus**: Prioritize long-term growth over short-term gains, as this will help Matthew ride out market fluctuations and stay on track with his career development and life goal achievements.
