1. Create a trust to manage and distribute wealth across generations.
2. Establish an education fund for your children's future expenses.
3. Develop a legacy plan to ensure the long-term preservation of your family's values and assets.

**Trust Strategy:**
Consider establishing a revocable living trust (RLT) to hold and distribute your assets. This will provide flexibility and control during your lifetime, while also ensuring that your wishes are carried out after your passing.

Create a dedicated education fund to support your children's future expenses. Consider the following options:

* **529 College Savings Plan:** A tax-advantaged plan that helps save for higher education expenses.

* **Benefits:** Tax-free growth and withdrawals, flexible contribution limits.

Develop a legacy plan to ensure the long-term preservation of your family's values and assets. Consider the following:

* **Family Governance Document:** Establish a document that outlines your family's values, goals, and expectations for future generations.
