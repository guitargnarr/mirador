**Performance Test Chain**

To ensure the accuracy and efficiency of our income processing rules, I'll guide you through a series of tests.

**Test 1: Clear Income Amount**

* Input: `$50,000`
* Expected Output:
	+ Cleaned amount: `50000`
	+ Response structure:
		- "Based on your specified income of $50,000..."
		- Comprehensive budget framework
		- Louisville-specific considerations
		- Implementation steps with local resources
		- Professional consultation recommendations

**Test 2: Income Amount with Units (e.g., per hour)**

* Input: `$25/hour`
* Expected Output:
	+ Cleaned amount: `25` (remove units)
	+ Response structure:
		- "Based on your specified income of $25..."
		- Comprehensive budget framework
		- Louisville-specific considerations
		- Implementation steps with local resources
		- Professional consultation recommendations

**Test 3: No Clear Income Amount**

* Input: `hello world`
* Expected Output:
	+ Clarification request: "Could you please provide a clear income amount?"
	+ Response structure:
		- "We couldn't extract an income amount from your input. Could you please provide a clear income amount?"
		- Comprehensive budget framework
		- Louisville-specific considerations
		- Implementation steps with local resources
		- Professional consultation recommendations

**Test 4: Income Amount with Comma Separation**

* Input: `$1,000,000`
* Expected Output:
	+ Cleaned amount: `1000000`
	+ Response structure:
		- "Based on your specified income of $1,000,000..."
		- Comprehensive budget framework
		- Louisville-specific considerations
		- Implementation steps with local resources
		- Professional consultation recommendations

**Test 5: Income Amount with Thousand Separator (e.g., k)**

* Input: `$100k`
* Expected Output:
	+ Cleaned amount: `100000` (remove 'k')
	+ Response structure:
		- "Based on your specified income of $XXX,XXX..."
		- Comprehensive budget framework
		- Louisville-specific considerations
		- Implementation steps with local resources
		- Professional consultation recommendations

**Test 6: Edge Case - Zero Income Amount**

* Input: `$0`
* Expected Output:
	+ Clarification request: "Could you please provide a non-zero income amount?"
	+ Response structure:
		- "We couldn't extract an income amount from your input. Could you please provide a non-zero income amount?"
		- Comprehensive budget framework
		- Louisville-specific considerations
		- Implementation steps with local resources
		- Professional consultation recommendations

By passing these performance tests, we can ensure that our income processing rules accurately extract and process income amounts, providing comprehensive financial guidance to users in the Louisville/Jefferson County context.

## Step 2: enhanced_agent_enforcer (execution time: 00:16)

**Enhanced Strategic Insights**

Building upon the previous output, I've identified key patterns and synergies that can enhance the income processing rules:

1. **Unit Handling**: The tests demonstrate the importance of handling different units (e.g., per hour, thousand separator) to ensure accurate extraction of income amounts.
2. **Edge Cases**: The tests reveal the need for clarification requests when encountering edge cases, such as zero income amount or non-numeric input.
3. **Comma Separation**: The tests show that comma separation can be used to represent large numbers, but it's essential to remove commas before processing.
4. **Local Considerations**: The tests highlight the importance of providing context-specific guidance, such as the comprehensive budget framework and Louisville-specific considerations.
5. **Implementation Steps**: The tests demonstrate the need for structured implementation steps with local resources and professional consultation recommendations.

**Implementation Framework**

To address these insights, I propose the following implementation framework:

1. **Input Validation**: Implement a robust input validation system to handle different units, edge cases, and non-numeric input.
2. **Comma Separation Handling**: Develop a mechanism to remove commas from large numbers and process them accordingly.
3. **Local Considerations**: Provide comprehensive budget frameworks and Louisville-specific considerations to ensure context-specific guidance.
4. **Implementation Steps**: Create structured implementation steps with local resources and professional consultation recommendations.

**Priority Action Plan**

Based on the enhanced strategic insights and implementation framework, I recommend the following priority action plan:

1. **Develop Input Validation System** (High Priority):
	* Implement a robust input validation system to handle different units, edge cases, and non-numeric input.
	* Integrate with existing income processing rules.
2. **Implement Comma Separation Handling** (Medium Priority):
	* Develop a mechanism to remove commas from large numbers and process them accordingly.
	* Test and validate the implementation.
3. **Create Comprehensive Budget Frameworks** (Low Priority):
	* Develop comprehensive budget frameworks for Louisville/Jefferson County context.
	* Integrate with existing income processing rules.
4. **Develop Implementation Steps** (Medium Priority):
	* Create structured implementation steps with local resources and professional consultation recommendations.
	* Test and validate the implementation.

**Success Optimization**

To maximize the effectiveness of these enhancements, consider the following success optimization strategies:

1. **Regular Testing and Validation**: Regularly test and validate the income processing rules to ensure accuracy and efficiency.
2. **User Feedback Mechanism**: Establish a user feedback mechanism to collect input and suggestions from users.
3. **Continuous Improvement**: Continuously monitor and analyze user behavior, and make data-driven decisions to improve the income processing rules.

By implementing these enhancements and prioritizing action plan, we can ensure accurate and efficient income processing rules that provide comprehensive financial guidance to users in the Louisville/Jefferson County context.
