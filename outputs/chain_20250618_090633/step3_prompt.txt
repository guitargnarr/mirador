**Louisville-Specific Cost of Living Considerations:**

Louisville has a relatively low cost of living compared to other major cities in the United States. However, it's essential to consider the following expenses:

* Food: Eating out in Louisville can range from $10 to $20 per meal, depending on the restaurant.

**Kentucky State Tax Implications:**

As a resident of Kentucky, Matthew will be subject to the state income tax rate of 5%. This means that for every dollar earned, he'll pay 5 cents in state taxes. To illustrate this, let's assume Matthew earns $175,000 per year and pays 5% in state taxes:

* State taxes: $8,750 (5% of $175,000)

**Local Financial Resources and Opportunities:**

Louisville has a thriving music scene, with numerous venues, festivals, and events throughout the year. Some local financial resources and opportunities include:

* The Louisville Music Commission: A city-funded organization that supports local musicians and music-related businesses.
* The Kentucky Arts Council: A state agency that provides funding for arts projects, including music initiatives.
* Local music schools and colleges: Institutions like the University of Louisville's School of Music and the Louisville Music Academy offer courses, workshops, and degree programs in music and related fields.

By leveraging these resources and opportunities, Matthew can further develop his skills, network with industry professionals, and grow his income streams.
